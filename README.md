# Navigator Self-Align ðŸš€

Navigator Self-Align is a Python library for augmenting training data via synthetic data generation for large language models (LLMs). It leverages techniques such as Evol-Lab ðŸŒŸâœ¨ (Evol-Instruct and Evol-Answer) and AI Align AI (AAA) ðŸ§  as described in the WizardLM-2 paper, to iteratively enhance data quality. The system integrates multiple LLMs in a co-teaching and self-improvement process, generating diverse and high-quality synthetic instructions, responses, and leverages Gretel evaluations for quality, adherence, toxicity, and bias.

## Features

- **Evol-Lab ðŸŒŸâœ¨**: Evol-Lab combines Evol-Instruct and Evol-Answer techniques to generate diverse instructions and responses based on given context and optionally provided examples.
  - **Evol-Instruct**: Generates diverse instructions based on given context and optionally provided instructions.
  - **Evol-Answer**: Generates diverse responses based on given context and instructions.
- **AI Align AI (AAA) ðŸ§ **: Optionally improves generated instructions and responses using a co-teaching and self-teaching approach. While AAA can add significant compute time, it generates the highest quality results in practice.
  - **Co-Teaching**: Iteratively improves the text using multiple language models.
  - **Self-Teaching**: Generates improvement suggestions and applies them to the text.
- **Quality and Fairness Judgements**: Navigator Self-Align evaluates the generated text on five dimensions:
  - **Conformance**: Measures how well the generated text aligns with the provided tags and descriptions.
  - **Quality**: Assesses the grammatical correctness, coherence, and relevance of the generated text.
  - **Toxicity**: Detects the presence of toxic content in the generated text.
  - **Bias**: Identifies any unintended biases in the generated text.
  - **Groundedness**: Evaluates the factual correctness of the generated text.
  
  A composite score is computed based on these dimensions, and the best-scoring text from each batch of generations is selected for the following steps.
- **Gretel Navigator Compound AI system and LLMs**: Used for synthetic data generation and evaluation of generated text. In fact, multiple LLMs and Navigator are leveraged to generate diverse and high quality results, leveraging the strengths and capabilities of any connected LLM to improve results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gretelai/navigator-self-align.git
   cd navigator-self-align
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Input Requirements

The input to this program is LLM training data in a pandas DataFrame format. You must specify one or more context columns, an instruction column, and a response column.

### Command-line Arguments

- `--loglevel`: Set the logging level (default: `INFO`).
- `--disable_aaa`: Disable AI Align AI (AAA) to improve runtime (default: `False`).

### Example Command

```bash
python main.py --loglevel INFO --disable_aaa
```

## Configuration

The data augmentation configuration is created using the `DataAugmentationConfig` class. This includes setting the number of instructions and responses to generate, temperature, token limits, and specifying the Gretel API key, primary model, and maximum number of co-teaching LLMs.

Fields are added to the configuration to specify the context, instruction, and response columns.

Example:

```python
config = DataAugmentationConfig(
    num_instructions=5,
    num_responses=5,
    temperature=0.8,
    max_tokens_instruction=100,
    max_tokens_response=150,
    api_key=GRETEL_API_KEY,
    primary_model=GRETEL_PRIMARY_MODEL,
    max_co_teach_llms=MAX_CO_TEACH_LLMS,
)
config.add_field("context", field_type="context")
config.add_field("instruction", field_type="instruction")
config.add_field("response", field_type="response")
```

## Data Augmentation Process

1. The `DataAugmenter` class is used to perform data augmentation. It takes the preprocessed dataset, configuration, and other options such as using examples, enabling AI Align AI (AAA), and specifying the output file.

2. The `augment()` method is called to generate synthetic examples. It constructs the context based on the specified context fields, generates diverse instructions using Evol-Instruct, optionally applies AAA to improve the instructions, selects the best instruction, generates diverse responses using Evol-Answer, optionally applies AAA to improve the responses, and selects the best response.

3. At each stage of generation, the generated texts are evaluated using Gretel Navigator on five dimensions: conformance, quality, toxicity, bias, and groundedness. A composite score is computed based on these dimensions, and the best-scoring text from each batch of generations is selected for the following steps.

4. The augmented data is saved to the specified output file in CSV format and printed as JSON for further processing or analysis.
