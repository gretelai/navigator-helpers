"Stalemate is a situation in chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check and has no legal move. Stalemate results in a draw. During the endgame, stalemate is a resource that can enable the player with the inferior position to draw the game rather than lose. In more complex positions, stalemate is much rarer, usually taking the form of a swindle that succeeds only if the superior side is inattentive.[citation needed] Stalemate is also a common theme in endgame studies and other chess problems.  The outcome of a stalemate was standardized as a draw in the 19th century. Before this standardization, its treatment varied widely, including being deemed a win for the stalemating player, a half-win for that player, or a loss for that player; not being permitted; and resulting in the stalemated player missing a turn. Stalemate rules vary in other games of the chess family.","What is the typical outcome of a stalemate in a chess game, and how has it been standardized over time?",92.14285714285714,"A stalemate in chess typically results in a draw.

"John Moses Browning (January 23, 1855  November 26, 1926) was an American firearm designer who developed many varieties of military and civilian firearms, cartridges, and gun mechanisms  many of which are still in use around the world. He made his first firearm at age 13 in his father's gun shop and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7, 1879, at the age of 24. He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries and pioneered the development of modern repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms.  Browning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design, especially the autoloading of ammunition. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns. He developed the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt, then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what is known as the pistol slide. Browning's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol, as well as several modern fully automatic weapons. He also developed the first gas-operated firearm, the ColtBrowning Model 1895 machine gun  a system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development.  Browning's most successful designs include the M1911 pistol, the water-cooled M1917, the air-cooled M1919, and heavy M2 machine guns, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, and the Browning Auto-5  the first semi-automatic shotgun. Some of these arms are still manufactured, often with only minor changes in detail and cosmetics to those assembled by Browning or his licensees. The Browning-designed M1911 and Hi-Power are some of the most copied firearms in the world.","What was the age of John Moses Browning when he received his first firearm patent on October 7, 1879?",95.71428571428572,24.,95.71428571428572,Who was John Moses Browning?,"John Moses Browning is one of the most well-known designer of modern firearms.

"Process mining is a family of techniques relating the fields of data science and process management to support the analysis of operational processes based on event logs. The goal of process mining is to turn event data into insights and actions. Process mining is an integral part of data science, fueled by the availability of event data and the desire to improve processes.Process mining techniques use event data to show what people, machines, and organizations are really doing. Process mining provides novel insights that can be used to identify the executional path taken by operational processes and address their performance and compliance problems.  Process mining starts from event data. Input for process mining is an event log. An event log views a process from a particular angle. Each event in the log should contain (1) a unique identifier for a particular process instance (called case id), (2) an activity (description of the event that is occurring), and (3) a timestamp. There may be additional event attributes referring to resources, costs, etc., but these are optional. With some effort, such data can be extracted from any information system supporting operational processes. Process mining uses these event data to answer a variety of process-related questions.","Instruction: Based on the context, identify the three mandatory components for each event in an event log used for process mining.",94.28571428571428,"The three mandatory components for each event in an event log used for process mining are: a unique identifier for a particular process instance (called case id), an activity (description of the event that is occurring), and a timestamp.",95.71428571428572,What is process mining?,"Process mining brings together data mining, data science and process management to find process efficiencies."
"In optics, a dispersive prism is an optical prism that is used to disperse light, that is, to separate light into its spectral components (the colors of the rainbow). Different wavelengths (colors) of light will be deflected by the prism at different angles. This is a result of the prism material's index of refraction varying with wavelength (dispersion). Generally, longer wavelengths (red) undergo a smaller deviation than shorter wavelengths (blue). The dispersion of white light into colors by a prism led Sir Isaac Newton to conclude that white light consisted of a mixture of different colors.","How does a dispersive prism use the varying index of refraction of its material to separate white light into its spectral components, specifically identifying which wavelength (color) experiences the greatest deviation and which one undergoes the least?",94.28571428571428,"A dispersive prism separates white light into its spectral components by exploiting the varying index of refraction of its material, which causes different wavelengths to be deflected at distinct angles.

"""Needles and Pins"" is a rock song credited to American writers Jack Nitzsche and Sonny Bono. Jackie DeShannon recorded it in 1963 and other versions followed. The most successful ones were by the Searchers, whose version reached No. 1 on the UK singles chart in 1964, and Smokie, who had a worldwide hit in 1977. Others who recorded the song include the Ramones, Gene Clark, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers with Stevie Nicks.  Jackie DeShannon version (1963) In his autobiography, Bono states that he sang along with Nitzsche's guitar-playing, thus creating both the tune and the lyrics, being guided by the chord progressions. However, Jackie DeShannon claims that the song was written at the piano, and that she was a full participant in the song's creation, along with Nitzsche and Bono, although she did not get formal credit.  DeShannon was the first to record the song; in the US it peaked at number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in May 1963.

"Different types of climbing warrant particular features for harnesses. Sport climbers typically use minimalistic harnesses, some with sewn-on gear loops. Alpine climbers often choose lightweight harnesses, perhaps with detachable leg loops. Big Wall climbers generally prefer padded waist belts and leg loops. There are also full body harnesses for children, whose pelvises may be too narrow to support a standard harness safely. These harnesses prevent children from falling even when inverted, and are either manufactured for children or constructed out of webbing. Some climbers use full body harnesses when there is a chance of inverting, or when carrying a heavy bag. There are also chest harnesses, which are used only in combination with a sit harness. Test results from UIAA show that chest harnesses do not put more impact on the neck than sit harnesses, giving them the same advantages as full body harness.  Apart from these harnesses, there are also caving and canyoning harnesses, which all serve different purposes. For example, a caving harness is made of tough waterproof and unpadded material, with dual attachment points. Releasing the maillon from these attachment points loosens the harness quickly.  Canyoning harnesses are somewhat like climbing harnesses, often without the padding, but with a seat protector, making it more comfortable to rappel. These usually have a single attachment point of Dyneema.","What features do sport climbers typically look for in their harnesses, and which type of harness often includes sewn-on gear loops?",90.0,"Sport climbers typically look for minimalistic harnesses, and some of these harnesses may include sewn-on gear loops.",92.85714285714286,Provide me a list of the different types of harnesses used in rock climbing,"Minimalistic Harness: has gear loops that are sewn on Lightweight Harness: has leg loops that are removable Big Wall Harness: uses padded waist belts and leg loops Full Body Harness: mostly for children with small pelvises, or for scenarios that risk inversion Chest Harness: to be used with a sit harness Caving Harness: made of ultra durable material and multiple attachment points Canyon Harness: has a built-in seat protector for rappeling."

"""I'm an Old Cowhand (From the Rio Grande)"" is a comic song written by Johnny Mercer for the Paramount Pictures release Rhythm on the Range and sung by its star, Bing Crosby. The Crosby commercial recording was made on July 17, 1936, with Jimmy Dorsey & his Orchestra for Decca Records. It was a huge hit in 1936, reaching the No. 2 spot in the charts of the day, and it greatly furthered Mercer's career. Crosby recorded the song again in 1954 for his album Bing: A Musical Autobiography. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.  Background Mercer and his wife were driving across the US en route to his hometown, Savannah, Georgia, after having apparently failed to succeed in Hollywood. Mercer was amused by the sight of cowboys, with spurs and ten-gallon hats, driving cars and trucks instead of riding horses. Singing cowboys were popular in films and on the radio then, and within 15 minutes, writing on the back of an envelope, Mercer transferred the image he was seeing into a song whose satirical lyrics vented some of his own bitter frustration with Hollywood.  The lyrics, about a 20th-century cowboy who has little in common with the cowpunchers of old, have been included in some anthologies of light verse.","Using the context provided, create a question that fully utilizes the information given and encourages a detailed response:

"In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.  In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.  The support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.",Who developed the support vector machines (SVMs) algorithm and when were the key papers published?,94.28571428571428,"The support vector machines (SVMs) algorithm was developed by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues at AT&T Bell Laboratories.

"Durga is a warrior goddess, and she is depicted to express her martial skills. Her iconography typically resonates with these attributes, where she rides a lion or a tiger, has between eight and eighteen hands, each holding a weapon to destroy and create. She is often shown in the midst of her war with Mahishasura, the buffalo demon, at the time she victoriously kills the demonic force. Her icon shows her in action, yet her face is calm and serene. In Hindu arts, this tranquil attribute of Durga's face is traditionally derived from the belief that she is protective and violent not because of her hatred, egotism or getting pleasure in violence, but because she acts out of necessity, for the love of the good, for liberation of those who depend on her, and a mark of the beginning of soul's journey to creative freedom.  Durga traditionally holds the weapons of various male gods of Hindu mythology, which they give her to fight the evil forces because they feel that she is shakti (energy, power). These include the chakra, conch, bow, arrow, sword, javelin, trishula, shield, and a noose. These weapons are considered symbolic by Shakta Hindus, representing self-discipline, selfless service to others, self-examination, prayer, devotion, remembering her mantras, cheerfulness and meditation. Durga herself is viewed as the ""Self"" within and the divine mother of all creation. She has been revered by warriors, blessing their new weapons.

"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are ""out""). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.","Identify the two methods by which a batter can be dismissed in cricket, and describe the specific actions that lead to each method.",94.28571428571428,"In cricket, a batter can be dismissed through two distinct methods: being bowled and being caught out. Let's examine each method in detail.

The first method, being bowled, happens when the ball collides with the wicket, dislodging the bails. This transpires when the bowler delivers the ball, and the batter fails to make contact with it or defend against it adequately. As a consequence, the ball strikes the wicket, and the bails are knocked off, resulting in the batter's dismissal.

The second method, being caught out, occurs when the fielding team successfully catches the ball after it has been hit by the batter but before it touches the ground. This dismissal can take place anywhere on the field, not just near the wicket. Once the ball is securely in the fielder's possession, the batter is considered out, regardless of whether they have completed a run or not.

"Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. These differences result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the wine production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine.

"Sunset, also known as sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon due to Earth's rotation. As viewed from everywhere on Earth (except the North and South poles), the equinox Sun sets due west at the moment of both the spring and autumn equinoxes. As viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun sets to the northwest (or not at all) in the spring and summer, and to the southwest in the autumn and winter; these seasons are reversed for the Southern Hemisphere. The time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the upper limb of the Sun disappears below the horizon. Near the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes sunlight rays to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the solar disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when a sunset is observed. Sunset is distinct from twilight, which is divided into three stages. The first one is civil twilight, which begins once the Sun has disappeared below the horizon, and continues until it descends to 6 degrees below the horizon. The second phase is nautical twilight, between 6 and 12 degrees below the horizon. The third phase is astronomical twilight, which is the period when the Sun is between 12 and 18 degrees below the horizon. Dusk is at the very end of astronomical twilight, and is the darkest moment of twilight just before night. Finally, night occurs when the Sun reaches 18 degrees below the horizon and no longer illuminates the sky.

"The most common cause of color blindness is an inherited problem or variation in the functionality of one or more of the three classes of cone cells in the retina, which mediate color vision. The most common form is caused by a genetic disorder called congenital redgreen color blindness. Males are more likely to be color blind than females, because the genes responsible for the most common forms of color blindness are on the X chromosome. Non-color-blind females can carry genes for color blindness and pass them on to their children. Color blindness can also result from physical or chemical damage to the eye, the optic nerve, or parts of the brain. Screening for color blindness is typically done with the Ishihara color test.

"Abraham Lincoln (/lkn/ LINK-n; February 12, 1809  April 15, 1865) was an American lawyer, politician and statesman who served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. Lincoln led the Union through the American Civil War to defend the nation as a constitutional union and succeeded in abolishing slavery, bolstering the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy.  Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in Kentucky and was raised on the frontier, primarily in Indiana. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. Congressman from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in central Illinois. In 1854, he was angered by the KansasNebraska Act, which opened the territories to slavery, and he re-entered politics. He soon became a leader of the new Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln ran for president in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began seceding from the nation. During this time, the newly formed Confederate States of America began seizing federal military bases in the south. Just over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, the Confederate States attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort in South Carolina.

"Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa. Livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east. Coconuts, pineapples, cashew nuts, cotton, sugarcane, sisal, and corn are grown in the lower-lying areas. Kenya has not attained the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security, and coupled with resulting poverty (53% of the population lives below the poverty line), a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid. Poor roads, an inadequate railway network, under-used water transport, and expensive air transport have isolated mostly arid and semi-arid areas, and farmers in other regions often leave food to rot in the fields because they cannot access markets.

"SR22s and SR20s built before 2003 were equipped with traditional analog instruments and a 10"" (later 12"") Multi-function display (MFD). In February 2003, Cirrus began offering SR22s with the Avidyne Entegra primary flight display (PFD), making the plane the first of its kind to come with a glass cockpit. Later that year, this instrumentation became standard equipment on all SR-series aircraft and sparked a major transition in general aviation, whereby over 90% of all new light aircraft by the year 2006 were equipped with glass cockpits. Retrofits are available for the older SR aircraft that replace the analog instrument panels with one that includes a PFD, a new MFD and the installation of back-up mechanical instruments.  On 22 May 2008, Cirrus revealed the ""Cirrus Perspective"" glass cockpit (by Garmin). Both cockpits were available for a while (the Avidyne cockpit was initially standard equipment) and after 2008 the SR22 was sold with only the Perspective panel.  In 2009, the third-generation Cirrus SR22 GTS came equipped with a new enhanced vision system (EVS), a sophisticated dual-wavelength instrument that offers both infrared and synthetic vision.  At the 2010 EAA AirVenture, Cirrus announced its plans to certify Garmin's ESP system (Electronic Stability and Protection) on the Cirrus SR22. It included advanced flight envelope protection that could stabilize the aircraft with the push of a button, to avoid spiral from developing.  The Cirrus Perspective-Plus avionics flight deck was introduced in 2017, with a faster processing speed, animated datalink weather, payload management, visual approach capabilities, wireless database uploads, glass back-up instruments, and more.

"The history of Yes Bank can be traced back to 1999, when three Indian bankers decided to launch a non-banking financial enterprise together. They were Ashok Kapur, who had previously worked as the national head for the ABN Amro Bank, Harkirat Singh, who had previously worked as the country head for the Deutsche Bank, and Rana Kapoor, who had previously worked as the head of corporate finance for the ANZ Grindlays Bank. The Rabobank in the Netherlands held the remaining 75% of the shares in the non-banking financial business. The three Indian promoters each owned 25% of the company. In 2003, it was rebranded as the Yes Bank. It was also the same year that Harkirat Singh resigned due to concerns over the influence exercised by Rabobank in the hiring of CEO and executive chairman positions.  Yes Bank has been unable to raise capital over the past few years, which has led to a steady deterioration in its financial position. This has resulted in potential loan losses, which in turn led to downgrades, which prompted investors to invoke bond covenants, and a withdrawal of deposits by customers. Over the course of the previous four quarters, the bank racked up losses and very little income. Rana Kapoor was fired as a result, and he was arrested in connection with a INR 466 crore money laundering case.  The bank's management, under the new leadership of Kumar, immediately repositioned itself and dealt with all internal and market related challenges to restore customer and depositor confidence.

"Landscape Arch is a natural arch in Arches National Park, Utah, United States. It is among the longest natural rock arches in the world. The arch is among many in the Devils Garden area in the north of the park. Landscape Arch was named by Frank Beckwith who explored the area in the winter of 19331934 as the leader of an Arches National Monument scientific expedition. The arch can be reached by a 0.8 mi (1.3 km) graded gravel trail.  The Natural Arch and Bridge Society (NABS) considers Landscape Arch the fifth longest natural arch in the world, after four arches in China. In 2004, the span of Landscape Arch was measured at 290.1 ft (88.4 m), 0.8 ft (0.24 m), with a height of 77.5 ft (23.6 m). NABS measured the span of the slightly shorter Kolob Arch in Zion National Park at 287 ft (87 m) in 2006.  The most recent recorded rockfall events occurred in the 1990s when one large slab fell in 1991 and then two additional large rockfalls occurred in 1995.

"Houseplants do not have an appreciable effect on the concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in normal home environments: it would require between 10 and 1000 houseplants per square meter to achieve the same level of VOC removal as occurs from passive exchange between indoor and outdoor air.   The idea that houseplants have an appreciable effect on indoor air quality is largely based on the Clean Air Study conducted by NASA in the 1980s. The study tested plants in sealed chambers and with highly elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (specifically benzene, trichloroethylene and formaldehyde). It concluded that to the extent that houseplants improve air quality, the mechanism of action is microorganisms within the potting soil, rather than the plants themselves.  Houseplants do have a statistically significant effect on the concentrations of both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in normal indoor environments, reducing carbon dioxide levels by 10-25% and carbon monoxide levels by up to 90%.  The effect has been investigated by NASA for use in spacecraft.  Plants also appear to increase the number and diversity of bacteria in homes, while reducing fungal diversity. They tend to increase humidity, reduce temperature swings, and reduce noise.  There are also many claimed psychological and physiological benefits to having houseplants. A critical review of the experimental literature concluded ""The reviewed studies suggest that indoor plants can provide psychological benefits such as stress-reduction and increased pain tolerance. However, they also showed substantial heterogeneity in methods and results. We therefore have strong reservations about general claims that indoor plants cause beneficial psychological changes.

"Magical thinking, or superstitious thinking, is the belief that unrelated events are causally connected despite the absence of any plausible causal link between them, particularly as a result of supernatural effects.

Two common examples of this fallacious thinking are: first, the belief that personal thoughts can directly influence the external world without any action taken; second, the notion that objects must be causally linked if they resemble each other or have come into contact in the past.

These beliefs demonstrate a clear lack of plausible causal link between events. In the first example, the idea that thoughts alone can alter external reality defies both logical and scientific explanations, as there is no observable or testable mechanism that can establish a causal connection between the two. In the second example, the assumption that objects must be causally connected due to their resemblance or past contact is also unfounded, as there is no evidence to suggest that such a connection exists beyond coincidence.

Therefore, magical thinking, as illustrated by these examples, relies on unjustified assumptions and superstitious beliefs, rather than on logical or scientific explanations, and should be distinguished from rational and evidence-based thinking.",92.14285714285714,What the the effects of houseplants?,"There are also many claimed psychological and physiological benefits to having houseplants.

"The division of labour is the separation of the tasks in any economic system or organization so that participants may specialize (specialization). Individuals, organizations, and nations are endowed with or acquire specialized capabilities, and either form combinations or trade to take advantage of the capabilities of others in addition to their own. Specialized capabilities may include equipment or natural resources as well as skills. Training and combinations of equipment and other assets acting together are often important. For example, an individual may specialize by acquiring tools and the skills to use them effectively just as an organization may specialize by acquiring specialized equipment and hiring or training skilled operators. The division of labour is the motive for trade and the source of economic interdependence.  Historically, an increasing division of labour is associated with the growth of total output and trade, the rise of capitalism, and the increasing complexity of industrialized processes. The concept and implementation of division of labour has been observed in ancient Sumerian (Mesopotamian) culture, where assignment of jobs in some cities coincided with an increase in trade and economic interdependence. Division of labour generally also increases both producer and individual worker productivity.  After the Neolithic Revolution, pastoralism and agriculture led to more reliable and abundant food supplies, which increased the population and led to specialization of labour, including new classes of artisans, warriors, and the development of elites. This specialization was furthered by the process of industrialization, and Industrial Revolution-era factories. Accordingly, many classical economists as well as some mechanical engineers, such as Charles Babbage, were proponents of division of labour. Also, having workers perform single or limited tasks eliminated the long training period required to train craftsmen, who were replaced with less-paid but more productive unskilled workers.","What are some examples of specialized capabilities mentioned in the context, and how do they contribute to the division of labour?",90.0,"Specialized capabilities mentioned in the context include equipment, natural resources, skills, and training.

"Technological advances also renewed interest in mental states and mental representations. English neuroscientist Charles Sherrington and Canadian psychologist Donald O. Hebb used experimental methods to link psychological phenomena to the structure and function of the brain. The rise of computer science, cybernetics, and artificial intelligence underlined the value of comparing information processing in humans and machines.  A popular and representative topic in this area is cognitive bias, or irrational thought. Psychologists (and economists) have classified and described a sizeable catalogue of biases which recur frequently in human thought. The availability heuristic, for example, is the tendency to overestimate the importance of something which happens to come readily to mind.  Elements of behaviorism and cognitive psychology were synthesized to form cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of psychotherapy modified from techniques developed by American psychologist Albert Ellis and American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck.  On a broader level, cognitive science is an interdisciplinary enterprise involving cognitive psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, linguists, and researchers in artificial intelligence, humancomputer interaction, and computational neuroscience. The discipline of cognitive science covers cognitive psychology as well as philosophy of mind, computer science, and neuroscience. Computer simulations are sometimes used to model phenomena of interest.","Which cognitive bias, mentioned in the context, is described as the tendency to overestimate the importance of something that comes readily to mind?",92.14285714285714,The availability heuristic.,92.14285714285714,"According to the paragraph below, what is Generative AI?","Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to AI systems that respond to user prompts to generate text, images and other media."

"Ouzo is a clear liquid. However, when water or ice is added, ouzo turns a milky-white colour. This is because anethole, the essential oil of anise, is completely soluble in alcohol at approximately 38% ABV and above, but not in water.

"In economics, the Gini coefficient, also known as the Gini index or Gini ratio, is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income inequality or the wealth inequality or the consumption inequality within a nation or a social group. It was developed by statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini. The Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution, such as levels of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values. For example, if everyone has the same income, the Gini coefficient will be 0. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 1 indicates that within a group of people, a single individual has all the income or consumption, while all others have none. The Gini coefficient was proposed by Corrado Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth.  For OECD countries, in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest. African countries had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 20082009, with South Africa having the world's highest, estimated to be 0.63 to 0.7, although this figure drops to 0.52 after social assistance is taken into account, and drops again to 0.47 after taxation. The global income Gini coefficient in 2005 has been estimated to be between 0.61 and 0.68 by various sources.","Generate a question that fully utilizes the context to test understanding of the Gini coefficient and its relationship to income equality:

"The Chinese Exclusion Act was a United States federal law signed by President Chester A. Arthur on May 6, 1882, prohibiting all immigration of Chinese laborers for 10 years. The law excluded merchants, teachers, students, travelers, and diplomats. The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first and only major U.S. law ever implemented to prevent all members of a specific national group from immigrating to the United States.  Passage of the law was preceded by growing anti-Chinese sentiment and anti-Chinese violence, as well as various policies targeting Chinese migrants. The act followed the Angell Treaty of 1880, a set of revisions to the U.S.China Burlingame Treaty of 1868 that allowed the U.S. to suspend Chinese immigration. The act was initially intended to last for 10 years, but was renewed and strengthened in 1892 with the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902. These laws attempted to stop all Chinese immigration into the United States for ten years, with exceptions for diplomats, teachers, students, merchants, and travelers. They were widely evaded.  The law remained in force until the passage of the Magnuson Act in 1943, which repealed the exclusion and allowed 105 Chinese immigrants to enter the United States each year. Chinese immigration later increased with the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which abolished direct racial barriers, and later by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished the National Origins Formula.",What specific groups of Chinese individuals were exempt from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882?,94.28571428571428,"Merchants, teachers, students, travelers, and diplomats.",95.71428571428572,Which major league baseball season is considered Sid Gordon's breakout year?,"Sid Gordon during his second stint with the New York Giants in 1948 had one of the best all around hitting performance seasons in mayor league baseball history.

"Coffee beans must be ground and brewed to create a beverage. The criteria for choosing a method include flavor and economy. Almost all methods of preparing coffee require that the beans be ground and then mixed with hot water long enough to allow the flavor to emerge but not so long as to draw out bitter compounds. The liquid can be consumed after the spent grounds are removed. Brewing considerations include the fineness of the grind, how the water is used to extract the flavor, the ratio of coffee grounds to water (the brew ratio), additional flavorings such as sugar, milk, and spices, and the technique to be used to separate spent grounds. Optimal coffee extraction occurs between 91 and 96 C (196 and 205 F).

"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are ""out""). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.  Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each ""over"" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.","What are the two ways a batter can be dismissed by the fielding side, according to the provided context?",91.42857142857144,"A batter can be dismissed by the fielding side either by catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or by hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket.",94.28571428571428,"Based on the text below, please summarise in a few lines","Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams witheleven players each.

"Although dogs are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans. For example, a review of the studies in dogs' competitive effects on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups.  Wolves kill dogs wherever they are found together. In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed. Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.  Coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. In particular, leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter what their size.

"Outcomes from Project Vesta have been integrated into firefighter training in Australia and are beginning to appear in the United States.  Firefighters try to stay out of the dead man zone at all times, working from safe points such as burnt ground or a large area of non-burnable ground, such as a cricket or Australian rules football oval, or a large car park. This is achieved by attacking the fire from the flanks, or the rear, so that burnt ground is always nearby, and the fire is always in front of the firefighters. This avoids two disadvantages of attacking fires at the head of the fire where spot fires may start behind them or changes in wind behavior might accelerate the spread of the fire.  The result of several inquiries into firefighter death in Australian bushfires found that firefighters should stay out of the dead man zone and that they should always keep 250 liters of water in their truck for personal safety. This is now a standard operating procedure in the NSW Rural Fire Service, Country Fire Service and Country Fire Authority in Australia.","Instead of asking about the two disadvantages directly, you could ask a question that requires the reader to identify and explain them based on the context:

"The first hammer forge was probably built in 1482 on the River Ohra. In 1592 the mill was bought by Tobias Albrecht, since when it has been named after him.

"After the widening project in 1992, Interstate 275 was increased to eight lanes on the bridge itself. However, this did not increase capacity on either end of the bridge. Backups were still seen on the Howard Frankland heading into Tampa, primarily due to a bottleneck at the SR 60/Veterans Expressway exit. On the St. Petersburg side, after a comprehensive reconstruction project that took over ten years, lane counts were increased from four lanes prior to the bridge to six lanes through downtown St. Petersburg, and eight lanes from Gandy Boulevard to the bridge.  A reconstruction project was planned to begin in 2017 for the new Gateway Expressway project, a plan to build a new toll road to connect different parts in Pinellas County. However, FDOT planned to reconstruct the interstate in smaller phases rather than the original larger two-phase project and the start of construction was delayed to 2020.  Once the reconstruction project is finished in 2025, major traffic congestion on the Howard Frankland bridge is expected to be significantly reduced by the addition of new lanes. On January 7, 2021, FDOT postponed by a week to January 16, 2021 the start date for removing an overpass and the corresponding exit ramp over I-275. It had been scheduled to shut down by 8 p.m., EST, January 9, through January 10. This work was part of the U.S. $600 million toll road project.

"Using llamas as livestock guards in North America began in the early 1980s, and some sheep producers have used llamas successfully since then. Some would even use them to guard their smaller cousins, the alpaca. They are used most commonly in the western regions of the United States, where larger predators, such as coyotes and feral dogs, are prevalent. Typically, a single gelding (castrated male) is used.  Research suggests the use of multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one. Multiple males tend to bond with one another, rather than with the livestock, and may ignore the flock. A gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation. Some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to lambing. Many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.  Using llamas as guards has reduced the losses to predators for many producers. The value of the livestock saved each year more than exceeds the purchase cost and annual maintenance of a llama. Although not every llama is suited to the job, most are a viable, nonlethal alternative for reducing predation, requiring no training and little care.","What is the age of a gelded male llama that is most effective as a livestock guard, according to the text?",94.28571428571428,A gelded male llama of two years of age is most effective as a livestock guard.,92.85714285714286,Give me the TLDR on using llamas to guard my livestock.,"TLDR: LLamas can be used as livestock guards.

"The leaves are usually large and imposing, often lobed or deeply cut, and may be more or less pinnate. They can also be oval, spear-shaped, or in many other possible shape variations. The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. A quality of philodendrons is that they do not have a single type of leaf on the same plant. Instead, they have juvenile leaves and adult leaves, which can be drastically different from one another. The leaves of seedling philodendrons are usually heart-shaped early in the life of the plant. But after it has matured past the seedling stage, the leaves will acquire the typical juvenile leaf's shape and size. Later in the philodendron's life, it starts producing adult leaves, a process called metamorphosis. Most philodendrons go through metamorphosis gradually; there is no immediately distinct difference between juvenile and adult leaves. Aside from being typically much bigger than the juvenile leaves, the shape of adult leaves can be significantly different. In fact, considerable taxonomic difficulty has occurred in the past due to these differences, causing juvenile and adult plants to mistakenly be classified as different species.","What are the typical shapes of philodendron leaves in the early stages of the plant's life, and how do they change as the plant matures, including any notable size and shape variations?",92.14285714285714,"Philodendron leaves in the early stages of the plant's life are typically heart-shaped.

"The E.S. Hoyt House is a historic house in Red Wing, Minnesota, United States, designed by the firm of Purcell & Elmslie and built in 1913. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also a contributing property to the Red Wing Residential Historic District.  Description and history The house is one of their more elaborate designs because its owner had a budget that allowed for lavish decoration. The result is comparable to the William Gray Purcell House and the Edward L. Powers House, both in Minneapolis. The horizontal lines of the Prairie School are more pronounced in this house; they are expressed in the bands of art glass windows on both levels and the cantilevered second story. Its owner, E.S. Hoyt, was the president of the Red Wing Stoneware Company.  The exterior is clad with brick on the first floor and red stucco on the second floor. The house has ten rooms and about 3,600 square feet (330 m2) of floor space. It has 99 diamond-paned art glass windows and a considerable amount of quarter sawn white oak wood ornamentation. The second story of the house is cantilevered over the first story. The entrance opens into a hallway that leads to a library on the left and a living room on the right. The living room, dining room, and an enclosed porch are all stretched across the front of the house and provide plenty of light through the art glass windows. Several of these windows provide panoramic views of the Mississippi River. The kitchen is located behind the dining room, although it has been remodeled since its original design. The second floor of the house has four bedrooms and two bathrooms, several of which have corner windows that expand the sense of space. The maid's room, over the kitchen, had a separate staircase.[","What design elements, such as the bands of art glass windows on both levels and the cantilevered second story, contribute to the horizontal lines of the Prairie School style in the E.S.

"In philosophy, praxeology or praxiology (/prksildi/; from Ancient Greek  (praxis) 'deed, action', and - (-logia) 'study of') is the theory of human action, based on the notion that humans engage in purposeful behavior, contrary to reflexive behavior and other unintentional behavior.

"The most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to Weimar were Gtz von Berlichingen (1773), a tragedy that was the first work to bring him recognition, and the novel The Sorrows of Young Werther (German: Die Leiden des jungen Werthers) (1774), which gained him enormous fame as a writer in the Sturm und Drang period which marked the early phase of Romanticism. Indeed, Werther is often considered to be the ""spark"" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first ""best-seller"". During the years at Weimar before he met Schiller in 1794, he began Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and wrote the dramas Iphigenie auf Tauris (Iphigenia in Tauris), Egmont, and Torquato Tasso and the fable Reineke Fuchs.To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the conception of Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years (the continuation of Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship), the idyll of Hermann and Dorothea, the Roman Elegies and the verse drama The Natural Daughter. In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared Faust Part One (1808), Elective Affinities (1809), the West-Eastern Diwan (an 1819 collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of Hafez), his autobiographical Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit (From My Life: Poetry and Truth, published between 1811 and 1833) which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his Italian Journey (181617), and a series of treatises on art.

"In addition to being well known for articles about scenery, history, and the most distant corners of the world, the magazine has been recognized for its book-like quality and its standard of photography. It was during the tenure of Society President Alexander Graham Bell and editor Gilbert H. Grosvenor (GHG) that the significance of illustration was first emphasized, in spite of criticism from some of the Board of Managers who considered the many illustrations an indicator of an unscientific conception of geography. By 1910, photographs had become the magazine's trademark and Grosvenor was constantly on the search for ""dynamical pictures"" as Graham Bell called them, particularly those that provided a sense of motion in a still image. In 1915, GHG began building the group of staff photographers and providing them with advanced tools including the latest darkroom.The magazine began to feature some pages of color photography in the early 1930s, when this technology was still in its early development. During the mid-1930s, Luis Marden (19132003), a writer and photographer for National Geographic, convinced the magazine to allow its photographers to use the so-called ""miniature"" 35 mm Leica cameras loaded with Kodachrome film over bulkier cameras with heavy glass plates that required the use of tripods.In 1959, the magazine started publishing small photographs on its covers, later becoming larger photographs. National Geographic photography quickly shifted to digital photography for both its printed magazine and its website. In subsequent years, the cover, while keeping its yellow border, shed its oak leaf trim and bare table of contents, to allow for a full page photograph taken for one of the month's articles. Issues of National Geographic are often kept by subscribers for years and re-sold at thrift stores as collectibles. The standard for photography has remained high over the subsequent decades and the magazine is still illustrated with some of the highest-quality photojournalism in the world. In 2006, National Geographic began an international photography competition, with over eighteen countries participating.","During the 1930s and 1950s, what technological innovations and photographic techniques did National Geographic adopt to enhance its visual storytelling?

"John James Monckton (28 October 1938  29 June 2017) was an Australian backstroke swimmer who won a silver medal in the 100-metre event at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Although he set multiple world records, he never won an Olympic gold medal.  An apprentice carpenter from the New England region of New South Wales, Monckton appeared to be primed to win gold at the 1956 Olympics. At the national team camp in Townsville before the games, he became the first person to swim 400-metre backstroke in under five minutes. Although it was not a regularly contested event at international level, it was a promising sign for the event to be included for medal competition in the Olympics. He also set world records in the 110- and 220-yard freestyle events.  At the Olympics, Monckton was the fastest qualifier in the heats and semifinal, but was upstaged in the final by teammate David Theile.  In the absence of Theile, who had retired after the Olympics to study medicine at university, Monckton dominated backstroke swimming, winning the 110-yard backstroke event at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff and also the 4110-yard medley relay. Monckton then prepared for another Olympics in 1960 in Rome, with Theile deferring his studies to defend his Olympic title. Monckton again led the qualifying in the heats and semifinals. However, in the final, he misjudged the turn and broke a finger. He limped home in seventh position, with Theile successfully defending his title. Monckton continued competing in the hope of reaching a third Olympics in 1964, but retired after his performances began to deteriorate.  He married Maureen Giles, an Australian swimmer at the 1956 Olympics.  He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1999.

"In common usage, climate change describes global warmingthe ongoing increase in global average temperatureand its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.  Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.","What are the main human activities that contribute to the increase in greenhouse gases, leading to global warming, as described in the context?",92.14285714285714,"Human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and certain agricultural and industrial practices, are the primary sources of the increased greenhouse gas emissions driving global warming. Fossil fuel combustion is the largest contributor, releasing approximately 65% of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Deforestation, which accounts for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, further exacerbates this issue by reducing the number of trees available to absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Additionally, some agricultural practices, such as livestock farming and rice cultivation, contribute methane, another potent greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere.

"Termination of employment or separation of employment is an employee's departure from a job and the end of an employee's duration with an employer. Termination may be voluntary on the employee's part, or it may be at the hands of the employer, often in the form of dismissal (firing) or a layoff. Dismissal or firing is usually thought to be the employee's fault, whereas a layoff is generally done for business reasons (for instance, a business slowdown, or an economic downturn) outside the employee's performance.  Firing carries a stigma in many cultures and may hinder the jobseeker's chances of finding new employment, particularly if they have been terminated from a previous job. Jobseekers sometimes do not mention jobs from which they were fired on their resumes; accordingly, unexplained gaps in employment, and refusal or failure to contact previous employers are often regarded as ""red flags"".  Dismissal is when the employer chooses to require the employee to leave, usually for the reason that is the employee's fault.

"Dartmouth Night starts the college's traditional ""Homecoming"" weekend with an evening of speeches, a parade, and a bonfire. Traditionally, the freshman class builds the bonfire and then runs around it a set number of times in concordance with their class year; the class of 2009 performed 109 circuits, the class of 1999 performed 99, etc. The College officially discourages a number of student traditions of varying degrees of antiquity. During the circling of the bonfire, upperclassmen encourage the freshmen to ""touch the fire"", an action legally considered trespassing and prohibited by police officials present. At halftime of the Homecoming football game on the Saturday of the weekend, some upperclassmen encourage freshman to ""rush the field"", although no upperclassman has seen a significant rush since several injuries sustained during the 1986 rush prompted the school to ban the practice. Among the two or three students who sometimes run across the field, those who are arrested are charged with trespassing (the independent newspaper The Dartmouth Review claimed to set up a fund to automatically pay any fines associated with freshman who rush the field.) However, in 2012 this was proven false when two students rushed the field and were arrested for disorderly conduct. The Dartmouth Review ignored their emails until finally replying and denying that this fund had ever existed. These students then had to pay $300 fines out of pocket.

"Amsterdam Centraal was designed by Pierre Cuypers, who is also known for his design of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. While Cuypers was the principal architect, it is believed that he focused mostly on the decoration of the station building and left the structural design to railway engineers. The station was built by contractor Philipp Holzmann. The new central station replaced Amsterdam Willemspoort Station, which had closed in 1878, as well as the temporary Westerdok Station used from 1878 to 1889. The idea for a central station came from Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, then the Netherlands Minister of the Interior and responsible for the national railways, who, in 1884, laid two proposals before the Amsterdam municipal council. In the first proposal, the station would be situated between the Leidseplein and the Amstel river. In the other, it would be built in the open harbour front allowing for the station to be connected to the existing main lines in the area to the west and the south, but also to a projected new northern line.",What were the two proposals presented by Johan Rudolph Thorbecke for the location of Amsterdam Centraal station in 1884?,94.28571428571428,"Johan Rudolph Thorbecke presented two proposals for the location of Amsterdam Centraal station in 1884.

"A running of the bulls (Spanish: encierro, from the verb encerrar, 'to corral, to enclose'; Occitan: abrivado, literally 'haste, momentum'; Catalan: correbous, 'run-bulls') is an event that involves running in front of a small group of bulls, typically six but sometimes ten or more, that have been let loose on sectioned-off streets in a town, usually as part of a summertime festival. Particular breeds of cattle may be favored, such as the toro bravo in Spain, also often used in post-run bullfighting, and Camargue cattle in Occitan France, which are not fought. Bulls (non-castrated male cattle) are typically used in such events.  The most famous bull-run is the encierro held in Pamplona during the nine-day festival of Sanfermines in honor of Saint Fermin. It has become a major global tourism event, today very different from the traditional, local festival. More traditional summer bull-runs are held in other places such as towns and villages across Spain and Portugal, in some cities in Mexico, and in the Occitan (Camargue) region of southern France. Bull-running was formerly also practiced in rural England, most famously at Stamford until 1837.","Which specific breeds of non-castrated male cattle are favored for running of the bulls events, and in which countries or regions can you find these breeds commonly used in such festivals?

"In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of artificial neural network most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. CNNs use a mathematical operation called convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers. They are specifically designed to process pixel data and are used in image recognition and processing. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, braincomputer interfaces, and financial time series.  CNNs are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant Artificial Neural Networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps. Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are not invariant to translation, due to the downsampling operation they apply to the input.  CNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Multilayer perceptrons are usually fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The ""full connectivity"" of these networks make them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization, or preventing overfitting, include: penalizing parameters during training (such as weight decay) or trimming connectivity (skipped connections, dropout, etc.) Developing robust datasets also increases the probability that CNNs will learn the generalized principles that characterize a given dataset rather than the biases of a poorly-populated set.","What are some typical ways to prevent overfitting in multilayer perceptrons, and how do CNNs address this issue differently?",90.0,"Typical ways to prevent overfitting in multilayer perceptrons include penalizing parameters during training, such as weight decay, and trimming connectivity through skipped connections, dropout, etc. In contrast, CNNs address overfitting differently by using shared-weight architecture of convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features, providing translation-equivariant responses known as feature maps.",92.14285714285714,"According to the given paragraph, how do convolutional neural networks avoid overfitting in machine learning?","A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has a fully connected layer in which each neuron is connected to every neuron in the next layer, this structure helps to avoid overfitting"

"Wittgenstein clarifies the problem of communicating using a human language when he discusses learning a language by ""ostensive defining."" For example, if one wanted to teach someone that a pencil was called a ""pencil"" and pointed to a pencil and said, ""pencil,"" how does the listener know that what one is trying to convey is that the thing in front of me (e.g., the entire pencil) is called a ""pencil""?

"Hygienic macros are macros whose expansion is guaranteed not to cause the accidental capture of identifiers. They are a feature of programming languages such as Scheme, Dylan, Rust, Nim, and Julia. The general problem of accidental capture was well known within the Lisp community prior to the introduction of hygienic macros. Macro writers would use language features that would generate unique identifiers (e.g., gensym) or use obfuscated identifiers in order to avoid the problem. Hygienic macros are a programmatic solution to the capture problem that is integrated into the macro expander itself. The term ""hygiene"" was coined in Kohlbecker et al.'s 1986 paper that introduced hygienic macro expansion, inspired by the terminology used in mathematics.","Instead of asking about the features used by specific programming languages, you could ask:

They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the untenable nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. At this time, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as ""the White Album"", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, as albums became the dominant form of record consumption over singles; they also increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy.

"In Greek mythology, Nike (/naki/ (listen); Ancient Greek: , lit.'victory', ancient: [n.k], modern: [ni.ci]) was a goddess who personified victory in any field including art, music, war, and athletics. She is often portrayed in Greek art as Winged Victory in the motion of flight; however, she can also appear without wings as ""Wingless Victory"" when she is being portrayed as an attribute of another deity such as Athena. In Greek literature Nike is described as both an attribute and attendant to the gods Zeus and Athena. Nike gained this honored role beside Zeus during the Titanomachy where she was one of the first gods to offer her allegiance to Zeus. At Athens, Nike became a servant to Athena as well as an attribute of her due to the prominent status Athena held in her patron city. The fusion of the two goddesses at Athens has contributed to the ambiguity surrounding Nike's origins. It is unclear whether she originated from a character trait of the Greek goddess Athena or has always existed as an independent deity. Her origin story in Greek mythology is also slightly ambiguous, with the Theogony claiming Nike to be the daughter of Styx and Pallas while the Homeric Hymns describe Ares as being Nike's father.

"Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server.

"At the dawn as a social science, economics was defined and discussed at length as the study of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth by Jean-Baptiste Say in his Treatise on Political Economy or, The Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth (1803). These three items are considered by the science only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution. Say's definition has prevailed up to our time, saved by substituting the word ""wealth"" for ""goods and services"" meaning that wealth may include non-material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, Lionel Robbins noticed that this definition no longer sufficed, because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science, he proposed a definition of economics as a study of a particular aspect of human behaviour, the one that falls under the influence of scarcity, which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economize (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). For Robbins, the insufficiency was solved, and his definition allows us to proclaim, with an easy conscience, education economics, safety and security economics, health economics, war economics, and of course, production, distribution and consumption economics as valid subjects of the economic science."" Citing Robbins: ""Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses"". After discussing it for decades, Robbins' definition became widely accepted by mainstream economists, and it has opened way into current textbooks. Although far from unanimous, most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins' definition, even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics, emanating from that definition. Due to the lack of strong consensus, and that production, distribution and consumption of goods and services is the prime area of study of economics, the old definition still stands in many quarters.","Instruction: Based on the context, identify the particular aspect of human behavior that economics studies according to Lionel Robbins' definition, and provide examples of valid subjects of economic science that fall under this aspect.

"Summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather. In Mediterranean climates, it is also associated with dry weather, while in other places (particularly in Eastern Asia because of the monsoon) it is associated with rainy weather. The wet season is the main period of vegetation growth within the savanna climate regime. Where the wet season is associated with a seasonal shift in the prevailing winds, it is known as a monsoon. In the northern Atlantic Ocean, a distinct tropical cyclone season occurs from 1 June to 30 November. The statistical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is 10 September. The Northeast Pacific Ocean has a broader period of activity, but in a similar timeframe to the Atlantic. The Northwest Pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round, with a minimum in February and March and a peak in early September. In the North Indian basin, storms are most common from April to December, with peaks in May and November. In the Southern Hemisphere, the tropical cyclone season runs from the start of November until the end of April with peaks in mid-February to early March.

"A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).  Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to process sequential input data, such as natural language, with applications towards tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers process the entire input all at once. The attention mechanism provides context for any position in the input sequence. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the transformer does not have to process one word at a time. This allows for more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduces training times.  Transformers were introduced in 2017 by a team at Google Brain and are increasingly becoming the model of choice for NLP problems, replacing RNN models such as long short-term memory (LSTM). The additional training parallelization allows training on larger datasets. This led to the development of pretrained systems such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which were trained with large language datasets, such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.","Generate a clear, specific question or instruction in everyday English that:

Response: Transformers are predominantly employed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers process entire input data sets all at once instead of sequentially. This feature, known as self-attention, enables transformers to provide context for any position in the input sequence. This allows for greater parallelization and a reduction in training times. Therefore, transformers are increasingly becoming the preferred choice for NLP tasks, such as translation and text summarization, and have led to the development of pretrained systems like BERT and GPT.",92.14285714285714,"The paper ""Attention is all you need"" proposed the Transformer model for the first time, which had a profound impact on the subsequent LLM. Please give the main core idea of Transformer described in this paper","This paper is by Vaswani, Ashish & Shazeer, Noam & Parmar, Niki & Uszkoreit, Jakob & Jones, Llion & Gomez, Aidan & Kaiser, Lukasz & Polosukhin, Illia. and published in 2017. It laid the foundation for the subsequent GPT series of models and BERT series of models. The GPT model uses the decoder part of Transfomer, while the BERT model uses the encoder part of Transfomer. The main core architecture of the Transformer model includes: Self-Attention Mechanism, Positional Encoding, Encoder-Decoder Architecture, Multi-Head Attension. Transformer effectively solves the difficult parallel problem of the previous RNN/LSTM model by using the Attention mechanism. Using Self-Attention solves the problem of limited labeled data in NLP. The sequence information in the input text is preserved through Positional Encoding. And Multi-Head Attention allows Transformer to learn different patterns of training data similar to Channel concept in CNN model."

Participants can include financial intermediaries (such as banks and brokers), institutional investors (such as investment managers, pension funds, insurers, and hedge funds), and issuers (such as companies and governments). Trading activity can take place on venues such as exchanges and involve clearing houses, although many transactions take place over-the-counter (OTC), that is directly between participants. Financial centres usually host companies that offer a wide range of financial services, for example relating to mergers and acquisitions, public offerings, or corporate actions; or which participate in other areas of finance, such as private equity, hedge funds, and reinsurance. Ancillary financial services include rating agencies, as well as provision of related professional services, particularly legal advice and accounting services.  The International Monetary Fund's classes of major financial centres are: International Financial Centres (IFCs), such as New York City, London, and Singapore; Regional Financial Centres (RFCs), such as Shanghai, Shenzhen, Frankfurt, and Sydney; and Offshore Financial Centres (OFCs), such as Cayman Islands, Dublin, and Hong Kong.   The City of London (the ""Square Mile"") is one of the oldest financial centres. London is ranked as one of the largest International Financial Centres in the world. International Financial Centres, and many Regional Financial Centres, are fullservice financial centres with direct access to large capital pools from banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and listed capital markets, and are major global cities. Offshore Financial Centres, and also some Regional Financial Centres, tend to specialise in tax-driven services, such as corporate tax planning tools, taxneutral vehicles, and shadow banking/securitisation, and can include smaller locations (e.g. Luxembourg), or city-states (e.g. Singapore). The IMF notes an overlap between Regional Financial Centres and Offshore Financial Centres (e.g. Hong Kong and Singapore are both Offshore Financial Centres and Regional Financial Centres).

"Edinburgh Castle is a historic castle in Edinburgh, Scotland. It stands on Castle Rock, which has been occupied by humans since at least the Iron Age, although the nature of the early settlement is unclear. There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century, and the site continued to be a royal residence until 1633. From the 15th century, the castle's residential role declined, and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half.  As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745.

The repeal of Glass-Steagall led to a blurring of lines between risk-averse commercial operations and risk-taking proprietary trading, increasing the potential for reckless behavior. The legislation promoting affordable housing, while well-intentioned, inadvertently created a demand for subprime mortgages that were later packaged into toxic assets, contributing to the crisis.",92.14285714285714,What caused the Global Financial Crises?,"There were multiple factors that caused the financial crises.  Two decades before the crisis, the U.S Government implemented multiple new laws to help encourage financing for affordable housing.  However, in 1999, portions of the Glass-Steagall act, which was passed by congress in 1933, was repealed and as a result, created more overall risk in the financial system as it allowed institutions to commingle low risk real estate investments with riskier investment operations.  The final major factor was a large increase in predatory home loan lending practices which targeted low-income, low-credit, uninformed homebuyers (mostly racial minorities).  The severity of these factors went unnoticed by U.S financial regulators and by the time the effects surfaced, the government was caught by surprise."

"Proteins are large biomolecules and macromolecules that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another.

"A rainbow is an optical phenomenon that can occur under certain meteorological conditions. It is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in an effect similar to a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun.  Rainbows can be full circles. However, the observer normally sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground, and centered on a line from the Sun to the observer's eye.  In a primary rainbow, the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side. This rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it.  In a double rainbow, a second arc is seen outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colours reversed, with red on the inner side of the arc. This is caused by the light being reflected twice on the inside of the droplet before leaving it.","What are the colors that appear on the outer and inner parts of a primary rainbow, and what is the process by which light is refracted, reflected, and refracted again to cause this color pattern?",92.14285714285714,"A primary rainbow displays red hues on its outer edge and violet shades on its inner side. This distinct coloration arises due to the refractive properties of light as it interacts with water droplets. Specifically, when sunlight enters a water droplet, it is refracted or bent, separating the light into its component colors based on their wavelengths. The light is then reflected off the inner surface of the droplet, reversing its direction. Upon exiting the droplet, the light undergoes another refraction, which further disperses the colors. Consequently, the observer perceives red on the outer edge and violet on the inner side of the rainbow arc.",94.28571428571428,"Without quoting directly from the text, tell me about rainbows.","Rainbows may appear when light passes through water.

"The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantium, was the continuation of the Roman Empire primarily in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople. It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. The terms ""Byzantine Empire"" and ""Eastern Roman Empire"" were coined after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire and to themselves as Romans[note 2]a term which Greeks continued to use for themselves into Ottoman times.

"Hawaiian scale is an expression of the height of a wind wave affecting water. It is the expression conventionally used by surfers in Hawaii and is also used in Australia and parts of South Africa.  The expression, always given in feet, is a scaled figure corresponding to roughly half the actual measured or estimated height of a wave's face (trough to crest height). Thus, a ""3-foot"" wave is roughly six feet high (in actuality a height of ~1.8 m), i.e., head-high to a 6-foot (~180 cm) person; a ""2-foot"" wave is roughly four feet high (height of ~1.2 m), i.e., chest-high to such a person; and a ""6- to 8-foot"" wave would be 2 to approaching 3 times head-high to such a person (height of ~3.5 to 5 m).

"Born in Vienna into one of Europe's richest families, Ludwig Wittgenstein inherited a fortune from his father in 1913. Before World War I, he ""made a very generous financial bequest to a group of poets and artists chosen by Ludwig von Ficker, the editor of Der Brenner, from artists in need. These included Trakl as well as Rainer Maria Rilke and the architect Adolf Loos."" Later, in a period of severe personal depression after World War I, he gave away his remaining fortune to his brothers and sisters. Three of his four older brothers died by separate acts of suicide. Wittgenstein left academia several times: serving as an officer on the front line during World War I, where he was decorated a number of times for his courage; teaching in schools in remote Austrian villages, where he encountered controversy for using sometimes violent corporal punishment on girls and a boy (the Haidbauer incident) especially during mathematics classes; working during World War II as a hospital porter in London, notably telling patients not to take the drugs they were prescribed; and working as a hospital laboratory technician at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne. He later expressed remorse for these incidents, and spent the remainder of his life lecturing and attempting to prepare a second manuscript for publication, which was published posthumously as the hugely influential Philosophical Investigations.","Using the context provided, identify the artists and poets who received financial support from Ludwig Wittgenstein before World War I, as arranged by Ludwig von Ficker, the editor of Der Brenner.",94.28571428571428,"Trakl, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Adolf Loos.",95.71428571428572,Do you think depression ran in Wittgenstein's family?,"Depression is a mental health issue which can sometimes lead to suicide.

"A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital identifier that cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided, that is recorded in a blockchain, and that is used to certify ownership and authenticity. The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the blockchain and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded. NFTs can be created by anybody, and require few or no coding skills to create. NFTs typically contain references to digital files such as photos, videos, and audio. Because NFTs are uniquely identifiable assets, they differ from cryptocurrencies, which are fungible.  Proponents of NFTs claim that NFTs provide a public certificate of authenticity or proof of ownership, but the legal rights conveyed by an NFT can be uncertain. The ownership of an NFT as defined by the blockchain has no inherent legal meaning and does not necessarily grant copyright, intellectual property rights, or other legal rights over its associated digital file. An NFT does not restrict the sharing or copying of its associated digital file and does not prevent the creation of NFTs that reference identical files.  The NFT market grew dramatically from 2020 to 2021: the trading of NFTs in 2021 increased to more than $17 billion, up by 21,000% over 2020's total of $82 million. NFTs have been used as speculative investments and they have drawn increasing criticism for the energy cost and carbon footprint associated with validating blockchain transactions as well as their frequent use in art scams. The NFT market has also been compared to an economic bubble or a Ponzi scheme. In 2022, the NFT market suffered a major collapse, with prices sharply falling; a May 2022 estimate was that the number of sales was down over 90% compared to its 2021 peak.","What is the characteristic that distinguishes NFTs from cryptocurrencies, according to the provided context?",90.0,"NFTs are uniquely identifiable assets, which distinguishes them from cryptocurrencies, which are fungible.",94.28571428571428,From the passage note down the valuation of NFT trade for the year 2020 and 2021.

"As an amateur, Fury represented both England and Ireland. Fury represented Ireland three times at international level. He was based out of the Holy Family Boxing Club in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and later switched to the Smithboro Club in County Monaghan, Ireland. In a double international match against an experienced Polish team in 2007, the Irish team lost 126 overall; Fury, however, was victorious in both his fights in Rzeszw and Biaystok. In another Irish match against the US, Fury won his bout by knockout. He won bronze at the AIBA Youth World Boxing Championships in 2006.  In England, while representing Jimmy Egan's Boxing Academy in Wythenshawe, Manchester, he participated in the senior national championships in 2006 but was beaten by David Price 228. In May 2007, he won the EU Junior Championship, defeating Istvan Bernath in the final. In July 2007 he won silver at the European Junior Championship, losing to Maxim Babanin in the final.  As a junior, Fury was ranked number three in the world behind the Russians Maxim Babanin and Andrey Volkov, but did not get the chance to represent Great Britain at the 2008 Olympics because each country is restricted to one boxer per weight division and David Price was selected. Price came up through the amateur Olympic programme. Fury also unsuccessfully tried to qualify for Ireland. Speaking in 2011, Fury said ""I should have gone to the Olympic games in 2008 and won a gold medal for Ireland, but I was denied the chance to go and do it"" He was also forced to withdraw from the Irish national championships after officials from the Holy Trinity Boxing Club in West Belfast, the club of the then Irish amateur heavyweight champion, submitted a protest regarding his eligibility as he was not born in Ireland.

Didius Julianus, who purchased the title from the Praetorian Guard, succeeded Pertinax, but was ousted by Septimius Severus and executed on June 1. Severus was declared Caesar by the Senate, but Pescennius Niger was hostile when he declared himself emperor. This started the civil war between Niger and Severus; both gathered troops and fought throughout the territory of the empire. Due to this war, Severus allowed Clodius Albinus, whom he suspected of being a threat, to be co-Caesar so that Severus did not have to preoccupy himself with imperial governance.

"Heat transfer is a discipline of thermal engineering that concerns the generation, use, conversion, and exchange of thermal energy (heat) between physical systems. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as thermal conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation, and transfer of energy by phase changes. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species (mass transfer in the form of advection), either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer. While these mechanisms have distinct characteristics, they often occur simultaneously in the same system.","Identify and describe the unique characteristics of each mechanism mentioned in the context of heat transfer:

1. Thermal conduction: How does heat transfer occur through direct contact between two materials without the presence of a fluid?
2. Thermal convection: Explain how the movement of a fluid (either naturally or forced) influences the rate of heat transfer.
3. Thermal radiation: How does heat transfer occur through electromagnetic waves in the absence of a medium?
4. Transfer of energy by phase changes: Describe the role of phase changes (such as melting, freezing, evaporation, and condensation) in the process of heat transfer.",92.14285714285714,"In the context of heat transfer, thermal conduction occurs through direct contact between two materials without the presence of a fluid. This process relies on the physical contact between the materials, allowing for efficient heat transfer at the interface. The unique characteristic of thermal conduction is its ability to transfer heat energy through the vibration of particles, enabling efficient heat transfer at the molecular level.

Thermal convection, on the other hand, involves the movement of a fluid (either naturally or forced), which enhances the rate of heat transfer by carrying heat energy from one location to another. The unique characteristic of thermal convection is its ability to increase the surface area for heat transfer through fluid circulation, thereby increasing the rate of heat transfer.

Thermal radiation occurs through electromagnetic waves in the absence of a medium, allowing heat transfer to occur over vast distances without the need for physical contact. The unique characteristic of thermal radiation is its ability to transfer heat energy through electromagnetic waves, enabling heat transfer across vacuum or gas gaps.

Finally, the transfer of energy by phase changes involves the transformation of a substance from one phase to another, such as melting, freezing, evaporation, or condensation. The unique characteristic of this mechanism is its ability to absorb or release large amounts of heat energy during phase changes, making it a significant contributor to heat transfer in many systems.",92.14285714285714,"From the paragraph provided, extract the mechanisms of heat transfer.","The mechanisms of heat transfer include thermal conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation, and transfer of energy by phase changes, although engineers also consider mass transfer in the form of advection a form of heat transfer."

"A parity plot is a scatterplot that compares a set of results from a computational model against benchmark data. Each point has coordinates (x, y), where x is a benchmark value and y is the corresponding value from the model.  A line of the equation y = x, representing perfect model performance, is sometimes added as a reference. Where the model successfully reproduces a benchmark, that point will lie on the line.  Parity plots are found in scientific papers and reports, when the author wishes to validate a model in a visual way. However, when the data have a wide range, the large scale makes important discrepancies invisible and the model appears better than it actually is.

"The term dead man zone was coined by members of the CSIRO research team in Australia who were investigating the spread of bushfires (Project Vesta). The dead man zone is approximately 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) around the fire that is likely to burn. This dead man zone can be a safety net for firefighters if the fire is moving at a high speed. The dead man zone can also be prepared in a way that slows down the fire. Firefighters can get outside the dead man zone safely without seeing what the fire is going to do and develop a plan of attack or defense upon the fire's next move. If the dead man zone is not used, wind change can sneak up on the firefighters and resulting in potentially unsafe distances where they are not able to defend themselves. This can be a life or death situation if not approached properly, and there have been examples of firefighters that became trapped and ultimately killed in Australia. Project Vesta, headed by scientist Phil Cheney, found that when the wind changes direction, the line of fire will move out at its maximum rate of spread almost immediately, and that the spread speed was nearly three times what was previously thought. Project Vesta's research into bushfire behavior makes up the majority of what is known about bushfires today.","Generate a clear, specific question or instruction in everyday English that:

The CF-105 held the promise of Mach 2 speeds at altitudes exceeding 50,000 feet (15,000 m) and was intended to serve as the Royal Canadian Air Force's (RCAF) primary interceptor into the 1960s and beyond.  The Arrow was the culmination of a series of design studies begun in 1953 that examined improved versions of the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, and serious development began in March 1955. The aircraft was intended to be built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase.

"Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) or sometimes just power point tracking (PPT), is a technique used with variable power sources to maximize energy extraction as conditions vary. The technique is most commonly used with photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, but can also be used with wind turbines, optical power transmission and thermophotovoltaics.  PV solar systems have varying relationships to inverter systems, external grids, battery banks, and other electrical loads. The central problem addressed by MPPT is that the efficiency of power transfer from the solar cell depends on the amount of available sunlight, shading, solar panel temperature and the load's electrical characteristics. As these conditions vary, the load characteristic (impedance) that gives the highest power transfer changes. The system is optimized when the load characteristic changes to keep power transfer at highest efficiency. This optimal load characteristic is called the maximum power point (MPP). MPPT is the process of adjusting the load characteristic as the conditions change. Circuits can be designed to present optimal loads to the photovoltaic cells and then convert the voltage, current, or frequency to suit other devices or systems.  Solar cells' non-linear relationship between temperature and total resistance can be analyzed based on the Current-voltage (I-V) curve and the power-voltage (P-V) curves. MPPT samples cell output and applies the proper resistance (load) to obtain maximum power. MPPT devices are typically integrated into an electric power converter system that provides voltage or current conversion, filtering, and regulation for driving various loads, including power grids, batteries, or motors. Solar inverters convert DC power to AC power and may incorporate MPPT.  The power at the MPP (Pmpp) is the product of the MPP voltage (Vmpp) and MPP current (Impp).  In general, the P-V curve of a partially shaded solar array can have multiple peaks, and some algorithms can get stuck in a local maximum rather than the global maximum of the curve.","What is the central problem addressed by Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, and how does it relate to the efficiency of power transfer from the solar cell?",92.14285714285714,"Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic (PV) solar systems addresses the issue that the optimal efficiency of power transfer from a solar cell is dependent on various conditions, such as sunlight availability, shading, solar panel temperature, and the electrical characteristics of the load. As these conditions change, the load impedance that yields the highest power transfer also varies. By continually adjusting the load characteristic to match the solar cell's optimal conditions, MPPT ensures the system operates at the highest efficiency, which is referred to as the maximum power point (MPP). This process is crucial for PV solar systems as it maximizes the energy extraction under varying conditions.",94.28571428571428,Which component of a PV solar system implements MPPT?,An MPPT device is usually integrated into the electric power converter system. The electric power converter system is responsible for voltage and current conversation like the DC to AC solar inverter.

Liver cancer can be primary (starts in liver) or secondary (meaning cancer which has spread from elsewhere to the liver, known as liver metastasis). Liver metastasis is more common than that which starts in the liver. Liver cancer is increasing globally.  Primary liver cancer is globally the sixth-most frequent cancer and the fourth-leading cause of death from cancer. In 2018, it occurred in 841,000 people and resulted in 782,000 deaths globally. Higher rates of liver cancer occur where hepatitis B and C are common, including Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Males are more often affected with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than females. Diagnosis is most frequent among those 55 to 65 years old.  The leading cause of liver cancer is cirrhosis due to hepatitis B, hepatitis C or alcohol. Other causes include aflatoxin, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and liver flukes. The most common types are HCC, which makes up 80% of cases and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The diagnosis may be supported by blood tests and medical imaging, with confirmation by tissue biopsy.  Given that there are many different causes of liver cancer, there are many approaches to liver cancer prevention. These efforts include immunization against hepatitis B, hepatitis B treatment, hepatitis C treatment, decreasing alcohol use, decreasing exposure to aflatoxin in agriculture, and management of obesity and diabetes. Screening is recommended in those with chronic liver disease. For example, it is recommended that people with chronic liver disease who are at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma be screened every 6 months using ultrasound imaging.  Because liver cancer is an umbrella term for many types of cancer, the signs and symptoms depend on what type of cancer is present. Symptoms can be vague and broad. Cholangiocarcinoma is associated with sweating, jaundice, abdominal pain, weight loss and liver enlargement. Hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with abdominal mass, abdominal pain, emesis, anemia, back pain, jaundice, itching, weight loss and fever.  Treatment options may include surgery, targeted therapy and radiation therapy. In certain cases, ablation therapy, embolization therapy or liver transplantation may be used."

"Sauvignon blanc is a green-skinned grape variety that originates from the city of Bordeaux in France. The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage (""wild"") and blanc (""white"") due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France. It is possibly a descendant of Savagnin. Sauvignon blanc is planted in many of the world's wine regions, producing a crisp, dry, and refreshing white varietal wine. The grape is also a component of the famous dessert wines from Sauternes and Barsac. Sauvignon blanc is widely cultivated in France, Chile, Romania, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Bulgaria, the states of Oregon, Washington, and California in the US. Some New World Sauvignon blancs, particularly from California, may also be called ""Fum Blanc"", a marketing term coined by Robert Mondavi in reference to Pouilly-Fum.  Depending on the climate, the flavor can range from aggressively grassy to sweetly tropical. In cooler climates, the grape has a tendency to produce wines with noticeable acidity and ""green flavors"" of grass, green bell peppers and nettles with some tropical fruit (such as passion fruit) and floral (such as elderflower) notes.

The word pizza was first documented in AD 997 in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods. Some commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be traced to pizzarelle, which were kosher for Passover cookies eaten by Roman Jews after returning from the synagogue on that holiday, though some also trace its origins to other Italian paschal bread. Other examples of flatbreads that survive to this day from the ancient Mediterranean world are focaccia (which may date back as far as the ancient Etruscans); Manakish in the Levant, coca (which has sweet and savory varieties) from Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands; the Greek Pita; Lepinja in the Balkans; or Piadina in the Romagna part of Emilia-Romagna in Italy"

"Treatment of ACO is based on expert opinion as there are no universally accepted clinical guidelines. Treatment is usually based on whether clinical features of asthma or COPD predominate. Inhaled corticosteroids are the primary treatment in those with ACOS. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) should be continued in those with asthma who develop decreased airway responsiveness to bronchodilators consistent with ACO. Therapy can be escalated to include a long acting beta-agonist (LABA) and inhaled steroid combination (ICS-LABA) or by adding on a long-acting anti-muscarinic inhaler (LAMA), known as triple therapy, in those with more severe or resistant disease.  Monoclonal antibodies targeting type 2 inflammation (which is predominant in asthma) have been used to treat severe asthma, and may also be used in severe cases of ACO. These monoclonal antibodies include omalizumab (an Anti-IgE antibody), mepolizumab (an anti-IL-5 antibody) and benralizumab (an anti-IL-5 receptor  antibody).

"Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric charge. Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others. The presence of either a positive or negative electric charge produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field. In most applications, a force acts on a charge with a magnitude given by Coulomb's law. Electric potential is typically measured in volts. Electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies, being used for: a. Electric power where electric current is used to energise equipment; b. Electronics which deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes and integrated circuits, and associated passive interconnection technologies. Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the 17th and 18th centuries. The theory of electromagnetism was developed in the 19th century, and by the end of that century electricity was being put to industrial and residential use by electrical engineers. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.","Generate a clear, specific question or instruction in everyday English that:

"Before the bridge was built, the only practical short route between San Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat across a section of San Francisco Bay. A ferry service began as early as 1820, with a regularly scheduled service beginning in the 1840s for the purpose of transporting water to San Francisco.  The Sausalito Land and Ferry Company service, launched in 1867, eventually became the Golden Gate Ferry Company, a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the largest ferry operation in the world by the late 1920s. Once for railroad passengers and customers only, Southern Pacific's automobile ferries became very profitable and important to the regional economy. The ferry crossing between the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Sausalito Ferry Terminal in Marin County took approximately 20 minutes and cost $1.00 per vehicle,[when?] a price later reduced to compete with the new bridge.

"Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration. The peasants were forced to grow indigo (Indigofera sp.), a cash crop for Indigo dye whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad.

"Coquerel's coua (Coua coquereli) is a species of cuckoo in the family Cuculidae. It is endemic to Madagascar. Its habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. It was named in 1867 by the French naturalist Alfred Grandidier in honor of the French navy surgeon and naturalist Charles Coquerel. Coquerel's coua is approximately 40 cm (16 in) in length and has a large blue patch of bare skin around the eye, a characteristic of the Coua genus that is similar to African turacos. The plumage is silky, the crown is black, the upper parts and tail are light brown or greyish-brown, and the lower breast and belly is suffused with red. The iris is red and the beak and legs are slaty grey.

"The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs, or ""dumb bombs"", into all-weather precision-guided munitions. JDAM-equipped bombs are guided by an integrated inertial guidance system coupled to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, giving them a published range of up to 15 nautical miles (28 km). JDAM-equipped bombs range from 500 to 2,000 pounds (230 to 910 kg). The JDAM's guidance system was jointly developed by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, hence the ""joint"" in JDAM. When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) identifier, superseding the Mark 80 or BLU (Bomb, Live Unit) nomenclature of the bomb to which it is attached.  The JDAM is not a stand-alone weapon; rather it is a ""bolt-on"" guidance package that converts unguided gravity bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). The key components of the system consist of a tail section with aerodynamic control surfaces, a (body) strake kit, and a combined inertial guidance system and GPS guidance control unit.  The JDAM was meant to improve upon laser-guided bomb and imaging infrared technology, which can be hindered by bad ground and weather conditions. Laser seekers are now being fitted to some JDAMs.","Identify the three main components of the JDAM system, as described in the context, that contribute to its function as a guidance kit for converting unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions.",92.14285714285714,"The three main components of the JDAM system are: a tail section with aerodynamic control surfaces, a body strake kit, and a combined inertial guidance system and GPS guidance control unit.",94.28571428571428,Why is JDAM so cost effective?,"The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs to precision-guided munitions. There are several reasons why JDAM is one of the most cost effective weapons ever invented.  By using GPS navigation, the JDAM guidance kit can be extremely cheap, as low as $25k/kit.  It is likely cheaper than any other precision-guided weapons.  GPS navigation provides good targeting precision, typically within meters. Combined with blast radius of 500-2000 lbs unguided bombs, JDAM can effectively destroy any targets on the ground.  Because JDAM has navigation capability, pilots no longer need to precisely aim the bombers  against the targets. It allows a bomber to quickly and precisely hit multiple targets along the route.  Some JDAM guidance kits include targeting sensors, such as laser targeting. They can be used against mobile targets, which further increases the use cases for JDAM.  In summary, by combining dumb bombs with a guidance kit, JDAM becomes a very cost effective weapon system, and is widely adopted by the US and other military forces."

"The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus), is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 6085 cm (2433 in) and weighs 415 kg (933 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.  Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxins that deter most other mammals from feeding on it. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala retrovirus.","What is the average body length and weight of a koala, and how does its fur colour vary depending on its geographical population?",94.28571428571428,"The koala, a marsupial native to Australia, has an average body length of 60.85 cm (24.33 in) and an average weight of 415 kg (933 lb).

"Quicksand, also known as sinking sand, is a colloid consisting of fine granular material (such as sand, silt or clay) and water. It forms in saturated loose sand when the sand is suddenly agitated. When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upward flowing water (as from an artesian spring).

"Solar power plants derive their energy from sunlight, which is made accessible via photovoltaics (PV's). Photovoltaic panels, or solar panels, are constructed using photovoltaic cells which are made of silica materials that release electrons when they are warmed by the thermal energy of the sun. The new flow of electrons generates electricity within the cell. While PV's are an efficient method of producing electricity, they do burn out after a decade and thus, must be replaced; however, their efficiency, cost of operation, and lack of noise/physical pollutants make them one of the cleanest and least expensive forms of energy. Solar power plants require the work of many facets of engineering; electrical engineers are especially crucial in constructing the solar panels and connecting them into a grid, and computer engineers code the cells themselves so that electricity can be effectively and efficiently produced, and civil engineers play the very important role of identifying areas where solar plants are able to collect the most energy.",What specific aspects of solar power plant design do civil engineers consider when identifying areas where solar plants can collect the most energy?,94.28571428571428,"When identifying areas where solar plants can collect the most energy, civil engineers consider the topography and orientation of the land, as well as the amount of solar irradiance the area receives, which varies throughout the day and year.

"Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero of the same name. Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp, it is the first installment in Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, and stars Tobey Maguire as the titular character, alongside Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The film chronicles Spider-Man's origin story and early superhero career. After being bitten by a genetically-altered spider, outcast teenager Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman abilities and adopts a masked superhero identity to fight crime and injustice in New York City, facing the sinister Green Goblin (Dafoe) in the process.  Development on a live-action Spider-Man film began in the 1980s. Filmmakers Tobe Hooper, James Cameron, and Joseph Zito were all attached to direct the film at one point. However, the project would languish in development hell due to licensing and financial issues. After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, it was licensed for a worldwide release by Columbia Pictures in 1999 after it acquired options from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, Carolco, and New Cannon. Exercising its option on just two elements from the multi-script acquisition (a different screenplay was written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom, John Brancato, Barney Cohen, and Joseph Goldman), Sony hired Koepp to create a working screenplay (credited as Cameron's), and Koepp received sole credit in final billing. Directors Roland Emmerich, Ang Lee, Chris Columbus, Barry Sonnenfeld, Tim Burton, Michael Bay, Jan de Bont, M. Night Shyamalan, Tony Scott, and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000. The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg during pre-production and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent during production.

"NGC 7314 is a spiral galaxy located in the southern constellation of Piscis Austrinus. It was discovered by English astronomer John Herschel on July 29, 1834. This is a nearby Seyfert (active) galaxy, located at a distance of approximately 54.6 megalight-years from the Milky Way. Since it appears to have detached spiral arm segments (either from dust lanes or bright star clusters), it was listed in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies.  Walter Scott Houston describes its appearance in small telescopes:  Do not let its photographic magnitude of 11.6 scare you off, for it can be seen in a 6-inch telescope as a curiously fuzzy object. But it is small, appearing only 4' by 2'.  The morphological classification of this galaxy is SAB(rs)bc, indicating a spiral galaxy with a weak central bar (SAB), an incomplete ring structure around the bar (rs), and moderatelywound arms (bc). The plane of the galactic disk is inclined by 64 to the line of sight from the Earth, with the major axis aligned along a position angle of 178. Within the galaxy's core is an active galactic nucleus tentatively classified as a type I Seyfert. The central supermassive black hole has a relatively low mass, estimated as (0.870.45)106 M.

Realizing that there could be a gap in the market, Handler suggested the idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband Elliot, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel's directors.  During a trip to Europe in 1956 with her children Barbara and Kenneth, Ruth Handler came across a German toy doll called Bild Lilli. The adult-figured doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel.

"Currently, only the United States fulfills the criteria to be considered a superpower. However, the United States is no longer the only uncontested foremost superpower and the world's sole hyperpower to dominate in every domain (i.e. military, culture, economy, technology, diplomatic).  Since the 1990s, China, the European Union, India, and Russia have been commonly described as potential superpowers. Japan was formerly considered a potential superpower due to its high economic growth. However, its status as a potential superpower has eroded since the 1990s due to an aging population and economic stagnation.","What countries, besides the United States, have been commonly described as potential superpowers since the 1990s?",94.28571428571428,"Besides the United States, China, the European Union, India, and Russia have been commonly described as potential superpowers since the 1990s.

These nations have the ability to significantly influence the world due to their combination of economic, political, and military might. While the United States and the Soviet Union were generally considered superpowers during the Cold War, the phrase has now come to refer to other nations as well.  Because of its fast expanding economy and military might, China is sometimes mentioned as a potential superpower. The nation's Belt and Road Initiative is viewed as a major step toward enhancing its worldwide influence. India, on the other hand, is a possible threat because of its enormous population, quickly expanding economy, and potent military.  Due to its combined economic and political might, the European Union is another prospective superpower. Despite having a small military, it has a substantial amount of influence and soft power. Another nation that has been mentioned as a prospective superpower is Russia, which has a sizable military and abundant natural resources. Yet, recent economic troubles could hinder its ability to rise to superpower status.  Brazil's enormous population, wealth of natural resources, and expanding economy are other factors that make it a prospective powerhouse. The nation's participation in international negotiations on climate change as well as its leadership in Latin America have contributed to an increase in its impact on the global scene."

"The avocado (Persea americana) is a medium-sized, evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae). It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated by Mesoamerican tribes more than 5,000 years ago. Then as now it was prized for its large and unusually oily fruit. The tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala. Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as an alligator or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed. Avocado trees are partly self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain consistent fruit output. Avocados are presently cultivated in the tropical and Mediterranean climates of many countries. Mexico is the world's leading producer of avocados as of 2020, supplying nearly 30% of the global harvest in that year.  The fruit of domestic varieties have smooth, buttery, golden-green flesh when ripe. Depending on the cultivar, avocados have green, brown, purplish, or black skin, and may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. For commercial purposes the fruits are picked while unripe and ripened after harvesting. The nutrient density and extremely high fat content of avocado flesh are useful to a variety of cuisines and are often eaten to enrich vegetarian diets.  In major production regions like Chile, Mexico and California the water demands of avocado farms place strain on local sources. Avocado production is also implicated in other externalities, including deforestation and human rights concerns associated with the partial control of their production in Mexico by organized crime. Global warming is expected to result in significant changes to the suitable growing zones for avocados, and place additional pressures on the locales in which they are produced due to heat waves and drought.","What is the origin of the avocado tree, and in which region is it believed to have originated?",94.28571428571428,The avocado tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala.,94.28571428571428,From the passage find the major production areas where Avocado is cultivated.

"The game's English name derives from the Balti language, from its word for 'ball', polo. It is cognate with the Standard Tibetan pulu, also meaning 'ball'.  Although the exact origins of the game are not certain, many scholars suggest it most likely began as a simple game played by Iranic and Turkic equestrian nomads in Central Asia. An archaic variation of polo, regionally referred to as buzkashi or kokpar, is still played in parts of Central Asia. It was developed and formalised in Ancient Iran (Persia) as ""chovgan"" (owgn), becoming a national sport played extensively by the nobility. Women played as well as men. During the period of the Parthian Empire (247 BC to 224 AD), the sport had great patronage under the kings and noblemen. According to The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity, the Persian ball game was an important pastime in the court of the Sasanian Empire (224651). It was also part of the royal education for the Sasanian ruling class.

"The Tomahawk (/tmhk/) Land Attack Missile (TLAM) is a long-range, all-weather, jet-powered, subsonic cruise missile that is primarily used by the United States Navy and Royal Navy in ship and submarine-based land-attack operations.  Under contract from the U.S. Navy, the Tomahawk was designed at the APL/JHU in a project led by James Walker near Laurel, Maryland, and was first manufactured by General Dynamics in the 1970s. It was intended to fill the role of a medium- to long-range, low-altitude missile that could be launched from a naval surface warfare platform, and featured a modular design accommodating a wide variety of warhead, guidance, and range capabilities. At least six variants and multiple upgraded versions of the TLAM have been added since the original design was introduced, including air-, sub-, and ground-launched variants with conventional and nuclear armaments. In 19921994, McDonnell Douglas Corporation was the sole supplier of Tomahawk Missiles and produced Block II and Block III Tomahawk missiles and remanufactured many Tomahawks to Block III specifications. In 1994, Hughes outbid McDonnell Douglas Aerospace to become the sole supplier of Tomahawk missiles.

"In domestic cats, many signals that occur when interacting with humans seem to originate from when the animal was dependent on the mother. Cats have been observed to purr for most of their lifespan, starting from when they were young and suckling from their mother. Purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signaling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens. Post-nursing cats often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating.

"Tardigrades are the first known animal to survive after exposure to outer space. In September 2007, dehydrated tardigrades were taken into low Earth orbit on the FOTON-M3 mission carrying the BIOPAN astrobiology payload. For 10 days, groups of tardigrades, some of them previously dehydrated, some of them not, were exposed to the hard vacuum of outer space, or vacuum and solar UV radiation. Back on Earth, more than 68% of the subjects protected from solar UV radiation were reanimated within 30 minutes following rehydration, although subsequent mortality was high; many of these produced viable embryos. In contrast, hydrated samples exposed to the combined effect of vacuum and full solar UV radiation had significantly reduced survival, with only three subjects of Milnesium tardigradum surviving. Also, it was found that the space vacuum did not have a significant effect on egg-laying in either R. coronifer or M. tardigradum. However, M. tardigradum exposed to UV radiation had a lower egg laying rate. In May 2011, Italian scientists sent tardigrades on board the International Space Station along with extremophiles on STS-134, the final flight of Space Shuttle Endeavour. Their conclusion was that microgravity and cosmic radiation ""did not significantly affect survival of tardigrades in flight, and stated that tardigrades represent a useful animal for space research."" In November 2011, they were among the organisms to be sent by the U.S.-based Planetary Society on the Russian Fobos-Grunt mission's Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment to Phobos; however, the launch failed.

Her legacy was to end the so-called 'post-war consensus' in the UK (characterised by high taxes, regulation and nationalisation) and to replace it with policies that encouraged free-enterprise and personal responsibility while acknowledging the importance of the welfare state, provided it was administered responsibly. Although disliked by many on the left for the way that she challenged excessive union power, she is generally acknowledged as the most important British politician of the late twentieth century."

"A foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of ""penal fouls"", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.  The referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been ""booked"", the referee writing the player's name in their official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of ""unsporting behaviour"" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute, substituted player, and to non-players such as managers and support staff.  Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as ""playing an advantage"". The referee may ""call back"" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within ""a few seconds"". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.  The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final. The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.","What are the examples of ""penal fouls"" that can result in a direct free kick or penalty kick, and how do they differ from other types of fouls punishable by an indirect free kick?",90.0,"Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent are examples of ""penal fouls"" that can result in a direct free kick or penalty kick.

"Another Hindu term that is sometimes translated as deity is Ishvara, or alternatively various deities are described, state Sorajjakool et al., as ""the personifications of various aspects of one and the same Ishvara"". The term Ishvara has a wide range of meanings that depend on the era and the school of Hinduism. In ancient texts of Indian philosophy, Ishvara means supreme Self, Brahman (Highest Reality), ruler, king or husband depending on the context. In medieval era texts, Ishvara means God, Supreme Being, personal god, or special Self depending on the school of Hinduism.  Among the six systems of Hindu philosophy, Samkhya and Mimamsa do not consider the concept of Ishvara, i.e., a supreme being, relevant. Yoga, Vaisheshika, Vedanta and Nyaya schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara, but assign different meanings.  Early Nyaya school scholars considered the hypothesis of a deity as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits; but these early Nyaya scholars then rejected this hypothesis, and were non-theistic or atheists. Later scholars of Nyaya school reconsidered this question and offered counter arguments for what is Ishvara and various arguments to prove the existence of omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent deity (God).","Based on the context, identify the specific meanings of Ishvara in ancient Indian philosophy texts and explain how these meanings differ depending on the context. For instance, in which texts does Ishvara signify the supreme Self or Brahman, and in which contexts does it denote a ruler or husband? Additionally, discuss how the meaning of Ishvara evolved in medieval era texts, particularly in relation to the concept of a personal god or Supreme Being.",92.14285714285714,"In the context of ancient Indian philosophy texts, the term Ishvara carries a multifaceted meaning, which can be interpreted as the supreme Self or Brahman, a ruler or king, or a husband, depending on the specific text and philosophical tradition. For instance, in ancient texts such as the Upanishads, Ishvara is often used synonymously with Brahman, denoting the ultimate reality and the source of all existence. In contrast, in texts like the Mahabharata, Ishvara is portrayed as a ruler or king, governing the universe and bestowing blessings upon his subjects. Similarly, in the context of the Bhagavad Gita, Ishvara is depicted as a husband, guiding and protecting Arjuna. These various interpretations reflect the rich complexity of Hindu philosophical thought and the evolving understanding of the nature of the divine.

In medieval era texts, the meaning of Ishvara became more explicitly associated with the concept of a personal god or Supreme Being. While the specific interpretation of Ishvara varied among different schools of Hinduism, many texts emphasized the idea of a benevolent deity who could be worshipped and interacted with through prayer and devotion. For example, in the Bhagavad Purana, Ishvara is described as the source of all compassion and love, who responds to the devotion of his faithful followers. This shift towards a more personalized understanding of the divine marked a significant departure from the more abstract and impersonal conceptions of Ishvara in ancient texts.

It is important to note that the evolution of the meaning of Ishvara was not a linear progression, but rather a complex and dynamic process that reflected the changing philosophical, cultural, and religious contexts of Indian society over time. Despite the various interpretations of Ishvara, however, the underlying belief in the existence of a divine power that governs the universe remained a central tenet of Hindu thought.",92.14285714285714,As per the passage which schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara?,"Yoga, Vaisheshika, Vedanta and Nyaya."

The Mercury Seven created a new profession in the United States, and established the image of the American astronaut for decades to come.  All of the Mercury Seven eventually flew in space. They piloted the six spaceflights of the Mercury program that had an astronaut on board from May 1961 to May 1963, and members of the group flew on all of the NASA human spaceflight programs of the 20th century  Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle.  Shepard became the first American to enter space in 1961, and later walked on the Moon on Apollo 14 in 1971. Grissom flew the first crewed Gemini mission in 1965, but died in 1967 in the Apollo 1 fire; the others all survived past retirement from service. Schirra flew Apollo 7 in 1968, the first crewed Apollo mission, in Grissom's place. Slayton, grounded with an atrial fibrillation, ultimately flew on the ApolloSoyuz Test Project in 1975. The first American in orbit in 1962, Glenn flew on the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1998 to become, at age 77, the oldest person to fly in space at the time. He was the last living member of the Mercury Seven when he died in 2016 at age 95.","What were the names of the seven original American astronauts selected for Project Mercury, and when were they publicly announced by NASA?",94.28571428571428,"The names of the seven original American astronauts selected for Project Mercury were Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton.

"The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (lead guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (rhythm guitar, vocals), Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead, originally known as the Warlocks, had played together in various Bay Area ensembles, including the traditional jug band Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they changed their name to the Grateful Dead; replacing Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and non-performing lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history.

"Food historian Lois Ellen Frank calls potatoes, tomatoes, corn, beans, squash, chili, cacao, and vanilla the ""magic eight"" ingredients that were found and used only in the Americas before 1492 and were taken via the Columbian Exchange back to the Old World, dramatically transforming the cuisine there.

"Horses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex. Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings, which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color. Many genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified. Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color, and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. The basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor, also known as the ""extension gene"" or ""red factor,"" as its recessive form is ""red"" (chestnut) and its dominant form is black. Additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as greying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.",What are the two basic coat colors of horses determined by the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor?,94.28571428571428,The two basic coat colors of horses determined by the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor are chestnut and black.,95.71428571428572,Give a comma-separated list of the different genes influencing horse coat colors according to the text,"""extension gene"" or ""red factor,"" palomino, dun, greying"

"Consequences  The most obvious consequence of overfitting is poor performance on the validation dataset. Other negative consequences include:  A function that is overfitted is likely to request more information about each item in the validation dataset than does the optimal function; gathering this additional unneeded data can be expensive or error-prone, especially if each individual piece of information must be gathered by human observation and manual data-entry.  A more complex, overfitted function is likely to be less portable than a simple one. At one extreme, a one-variable linear regression is so portable that, if necessary, it could even be done by hand. At the other extreme are models that can be reproduced only by exactly duplicating the original modeler's entire setup, making reuse or scientific reproduction difficult.  It may be possible to reconstruct details of individual training instances from an overfitted machine learning model's training set. This may be undesirable if, for example, the training data includes sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). This phenomenon also presents problems in the area of artificial intelligence and copyright, with the developers of some generative deep learning models such as Stable Diffusion and GitHub Copilot being sued for copyright infringement because these models have been found to be capable of reproducing certain copyrighted items from their training data.","What are some negative consequences of overfitting a machine learning model, and how might these consequences affect its portability and potential use?",92.14285714285714,"Overfitting a machine learning model has several negative consequences that significantly impact its portability and potential use.

"Pinot Gris, Pinot Grigio (US: /pino ridio, -do/, UK: /rdio/) or Grauburgunder is a white wine grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera. Thought to be a mutant clone of the Pinot Noir variety, it normally has a grayish-blue fruit, accounting for its name, but the grapes can have a brownish pink to black and even white appearance. The word pinot could have been given to it because the grapes grow in small pinecone-shaped clusters. The wines produced from this grape also vary in color from a deep golden yellow to copper and even a light shade of pink, and it is one of the more popular grapes for skin-contact wine.  Pinot Gris is grown around the globe, with the ""spicy"" full-bodied Alsatian and lighter-bodied, more acidic Italian styles being most widely recognized. The Alsatian style, often duplicated in New World wine regions such as Marlborough, Tasmania, South Australia, Washington, Oregon, and South Africa tend to have moderate to low acidity, higher alcohol levels and an almost ""oily"" texture that contributes to the full-bodied nature of the wine. The flavors can range from ripe tropical fruit notes of melon and mango to some botrytis-influenced flavors. In Italy, Pinot grigio grapes are often harvested early to retain the refreshing acidity and minimize some of the overt-fruitiness of the variety, creating a more neutral flavor profile. This style is often imitated in other Old World wine regions, such as Germany, where the grape is known as Rulnder, or more commonly, Grauburgunder.","How does the winemaking process and resulting characteristics of Pinot Gris wines differ between the Alsatian and Italian styles, as described in the context?",92.14285714285714,"The Alsatian style of Pinot Gris wines tends to have moderate to low acidity, higher alcohol levels, and an ""oily"" texture, resulting in a full-bodied wine.

"One origin story holds that Reuben Kulakofsky (his first name sometimes spelled Reubin; his last name sometimes shortened to Kay), a Lithuanian-born Jewish grocer residing in Omaha, Nebraska, asked for a sandwich made of corned beef and sauerkraut at his weekly poker game held in the Blackstone Hotel from around 1920 through 1935. The participants, who nicknamed themselves ""the committee"", included the hotel's owner, Charles Schimmel. Schimmel's son, who worked in the kitchen, made the first Reuben for him, adding Swiss cheese and thousand island dressing to his order, putting the whole thing on rye bread. The sandwich first gained local fame when Schimmel put it on the Blackstone's lunch menu, and its fame spread when a former employee of the hotel won the national sandwich idea contest with the recipe. In Omaha, Nebraska, March 14 was proclaimed Reuben Sandwich Day.  Another account holds that the Reuben's creator was Arnold Reuben, the German-Jewish owner of Reuben's Delicatessen (19082001) in New York City. According to an interview with Craig Claiborne, Arnold Reuben created the ""Reuben Special"" around 1914. Bernard Sobel in his 1953 book, Broadway Heartbeat: Memoirs of a Press Agent states that the sandwich was an extemporaneous creation for Marjorie Rambeau, inaugurated when the Broadway actress visited the Reuben's Delicatessen one night when the cupboards were particularly bare.  Still other versions give credit to Alfred Scheuing, a chef at Reuben's Delicatessen, and say he created the sandwich for Reuben's son, Arnold Jr., in the 1930s.","Create a detailed description of the sandwich that was first made for Reuben Kulakofsky at his weekly poker game in the Blackstone Hotel around 1920-1935. What type of bread was used, and what were the primary ingredients (corned beef and sauerkraut) requested by Reuben?

They started by layering corned beef and sauerkraut on a slice of rye bread. To enhance the flavors, they added a generous amount of Swiss cheese, which melted beautifully between the meat and the sauerkraut. To finish it off, they drizzled thousand island dressing over the top, creating a tangy and savory complement to the other ingredients.

"Those who think that intelligent extraterrestrial life is (nearly) impossible argue that the conditions needed for the evolution of lifeor at least the evolution of biological complexityare rare or even unique to Earth. Under this assumption, called the rare Earth hypothesis, a rejection of the mediocrity principle, complex multicellular life is regarded as exceedingly unusual.  The rare Earth hypothesis argues that the evolution of biological complexity requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a galactic habitable zone, a star and planet(s) having the requisite conditions, such as enough of a continuous habitable zone, the advantage of a giant guardian like Jupiter and a large moon, conditions needed to ensure the planet has a magnetosphere and plate tectonics, the chemistry of the lithosphere, atmosphere, and oceans, the role of ""evolutionary pumps"" such as massive glaciation and rare bolide impacts. And perhaps most importantly, advanced life needs whatever it was that led to the transition of (some) prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, sexual reproduction and the Cambrian explosion.  In his book Wonderful Life (1989), Stephen Jay Gould suggested that if the ""tape of life"" were rewound to the time of the Cambrian explosion, and one or two tweaks made, human beings most probably never would have evolved.

"When a king is under immediate attack, it is said to be in check. A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check. This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check.  The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to get it out of check.

"The meaning of life, or the answer to the question: ""What is the meaning of life?"", pertains to the significance of living or existence in general. Many other related questions include: ""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"", or ""What is the purpose of existence?"" There have been many proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question.  The meaning of life can be derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness. Many other issues are also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the ""how"" of life.

"Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.  Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often used to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.  Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods. The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. In the 20th century, coffee became a global commodity, creating different coffee cultures around the world.  The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world's total. Green, unroasted coffee is traded as an agricultural commodity. Despite sales of coffee reaching billions of dollars worldwide, farmers producing coffee beans disproportionately live in poverty. Critics of the coffee industry have also pointed to its negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use",What are the two most commonly grown coffee bean types mentioned in the context?,88.57142857142857,The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta.,95.71428571428572,"Based on the reference text about coffee, tell me where coffee plants are primarily grown and the most common bean types.","Coffee plants are cultivated mainly in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa.

"A column-oriented DBMS or columnar DBMS is a database management system (DBMS) that stores data tables by column rather than by row. Benefits include more efficient access to data when only querying a subset of columns (by eliminating the need to read columns that are not relevant), and more options for data compression. However, they are typically less efficient for inserting new data.  Practical use of a column store versus a row store differs little in the relational DBMS world. Both columnar and row databases can use traditional database query languages like SQL to load data and perform queries. Both row and columnar databases can become the backbone in a system to serve data for common extract, transform, load (ETL) and tools.","What benefits does a column-oriented DBMS offer when querying a subset of columns, and how does it achieve these benefits?",92.14285714285714,"When querying a subset of columns in a column-oriented DBMS, the primary benefits include reduced query latency and data compression. These benefits are achieved through the system's columnar storage architecture, which enables selective reading of only the required columns instead of reading entire rows that may contain irrelevant data. This allows the database to focus on the specific columns needed, resulting in faster query execution and reduced I/O requirements. Additionally, columnar storage enables more effective data compression techniques, as data within a single column can often be compressed more efficiently due to its homogeneity, leading to significant storage savings and improved data management.",92.14285714285714,"Given this reference text, what are column stores used for?",A column store database stores data as any other database management system. The data itself is stored sequentially to improve the performance of scans on a subset of individual columns.

"In Sweden, as well as Norway, a trollkors or troll cross is a bent piece of iron worn as an amulet to ward off malevolent magic, allegedly stemming from medieval Sweden. According to those claiming its authenticity it represented the Norse symbol of protection; thus if a Norseman wore this symbol, they believed that chances of falling into danger would decrease. However, although commonly thought of as a part of Swedish folklore, it was first createdas an item of jewelryby the smith Kari Erlands from western Dalarna, sometime in the late 1990s. It was claimed to have been a copy of a protective rune found at her grandparents' farm, but this has not been verified. While it does bear some resemblance to the othala rune in Elder Futhark and Anglo-Saxon runic writing systems, it is more likely that Erlands mistook a Bumerke for a protective symbol.","What region in Sweden did Kari Erlands, the smith who created the trollkors as an item of jewelry, hail from, and in what year did she create it?",87.14285714285714,"Kari Erlands, the smith who created the trollkors as an item of jewelry, hailed from western Dalarna in Sweden, and she created it in the late 1990s.",92.85714285714286,"Based on the given text, please tell me which region and country a Troll Cross originated in, and what its intent is.",The Troll Cross originated in the western Dalarna region of Sweden.

In May 1857 the couple were resident in the military cantonments outside Delhi, where Robert Tytler's regiment, the 38th Bengal Native Infantry was one of the first to mutiny during the great rebellion of that year. Because she was heavily pregnant, Harriet was allowed to stay on and was the only British woman present at the Siege of Delhi. She later gave birth in a donkey cart while escaping to safer areas. They named this third child Stanley Delhi-Force Tytler.

"A battery storage power station is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy. Battery storage is the fastest responding dispatchable source of power on electric grids, and it is used to stabilise those grids, as battery storage can transition from standby to full power in under a second to deal with grid contingencies.  At full rated power, battery storage power stations are generally designed to output for up to a few hours. Battery storage can be used for short-term peak power and ancillary services, such as providing operating reserve and frequency control to minimize the chance of power outages. They are often installed at, or close to, other active or disused power stations and may share the same grid connection to reduce costs. Since battery storage plants require no deliveries of fuel, are compact compared to generating stations and have no chimneys or large cooling systems, they can be rapidly installed and placed if necessary within urban areas, close to customer load.",What are the primary benefits of battery storage power stations in terms of grid stability and power supply?,92.14285714285714,"The primary benefits of battery storage power stations in terms of grid stability and power supply are their ability to rapidly respond to grid contingencies, providing the fastest dispatchable source of power on electric grids.

Thematically, his work covers topics such as his Catholic spirituality, jazz, travel, promiscuity, life in New York City, Buddhism, drugs, and poverty. He became an underground celebrity and, with other Beats, a progenitor of the hippie movement, although he remained antagonistic toward some of its politically radical elements. He has a lasting legacy, greatly influencing many of the cultural icons of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Jerry Garcia and the Doors.

"The origins of personality assessment date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when personality was assessed through phrenology, the measurement of bumps on the human skull, and physiognomy, which assessed personality based on a person's outer appearances. Sir Francis Galton took another approach to assessing personality late in the 19th century. Based on the lexical hypothesis, Galton estimated the number of adjectives that described personality in the English dictionary. Galton's list was eventually refined by Louis Leon Thurstone to 60 words that were commonly used for describing personality at the time. Through factor analyzing responses from 1300 participants, Thurstone was able to reduce this severely restricted pool of 60 adjectives into seven common factors. This procedure of factor analyzing common adjectives was later utilized by Raymond Cattell (7th most highly cited psychologist of the 20th Centurybased on the peer-reviewed journal literature), who subsequently utilized a data set of over 4000 affect terms from the English dictionary that eventually resulted in construction of the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) which also measured up to eight second-stratum personality factors. Of the many introspective (i.e., subjective) self-report instruments constructed to measure the putative Big Five personality dimensions, perhaps the most popular has been the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) However, the psychometric properties of the NEO-PI-R (including its factor analytic/construct validity) has been severely criticized.","1.

"World War I or the First World War (28 July 1914  11 November 1918), often abbreviated as WWI, was one of the deadliest global conflicts in history. The first decade of the 20th century saw increasing diplomatic tension between the European great powers. This reached breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July. Russia came to Serbia's defense, and by 4 August, defensive alliances had drawn in Germany, France, and Britain. German strategy in 1914 was to first defeat France, then attack Russia. However, this failed, and by the end of 1914, the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more fluid, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite a series of costly offensives. Attempts by both sides to bypass the stalemate caused fighting to expand into the Middle East, the Alps, the Balkans, and overseas colonies, bringing Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and others into the war.","What were the main events leading to the outbreak of World War I, and how did the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand contribute to the start of the conflict?",92.14285714285714,"The main events leading to the outbreak of World War I were the increasing diplomatic tension between European great powers, culminating in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914.

"A rainbow is an optical phenomenon that can occur under certain meteorological conditions. It is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in an effect similar to a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc. Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun. Rainbows can be full circles. However, the observer normally sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground, and centered on a line from the Sun to the observer's eye. In a primary rainbow, the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side. This rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it. In a double rainbow, a second arc is seen outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colours reversed, with red on the inner side of the arc. This is caused by the light being reflected twice on the inside of the droplet before leaving it.","Question: In a primary rainbow, which color appears on the outer edge and which one on the inner edge, and how is this rainbow formed through the interaction of light with water droplets?",94.28571428571428,"In a primary rainbow, the color red appears on the outer edge and violet on the inner edge.

"An artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothetical intelligent agent which can understand or learn any intellectual task that human beings or other animals can. AGI has also been defined alternatively as autonomous systems that surpass human capabilities at the majority of economically valuable work. Developing AGI is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and for several AI companies such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, as well as a common topic in science fiction and futures studies.  The timeline for AGI development remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts, with some arguing it may be possible in the coming decades, while others maintain it might take much longer or may never be achieved at all. Additionally, there is debate regarding whether modern deep learning systems, such as GPT-4, are an early yet incomplete form of AGI or if new approaches will be required.","What are the two definitions of artificial general intelligence (AGI) mentioned in the context, and how do they differ from each other?",94.28571428571428,"The context presents two definitions of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

"Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease affecting ruminants, dogs, and horses, and is caused by Anaplasma bacteria. Anaplasmosis is an infectious but not contagious disease. Anaplasmosis can be transmitted through mechanical and biological vector processes. Anaplasmosis can also be referred to as ""yellow bag"" or ""yellow fever"" because the infected animal can develop a jaundiced look. Other signs of infection include weight loss, diarrhea, paleness of the skin, aggressive behavior, and high fever.  Many different tick species can carry the bacteria that cause anaplasmosis. The two major bacterial pathogens are Anaplasma marginale and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. These microorganisms are Gram-negative, and infect red blood cells. Once the host is infected with anaplasmosis, the immune system will try to fight off and kill the infected red blood cells, but will also kill healthy red blood cells. The Anaplasma sparouinense species is responsible for a rare zoonosis, the Sparouine anaplasmosis, detected only in French Guiana, South America. This disease was described from a clandestine gold miner working deep in rainforest. Infection of his red blood cells led to a severe deterioration of his health and required his hospitalization. Molecular typing showed that Anaplasma sparouinense is distinct to all known species and more genetically related to recently described Anaplasma species causing infections in rainforest wild fauna of Brazil.  While there are no current live or inactivated vaccines effective for all strains of A. marginale approved by the USDA for anaplasmosis, there are other means of prevention. Tick and fly control for herds of ruminants can be effective but also labor intensive. Chemical methods can also be used, including sanitizing surgical equipment after each use. Tetracycline drugs are the most common treatment for anaplasmosis, and can provide the animal with immunity for a period of time. The disease is more common in the South and West parts of the United States, but is no longer considered a major problem since the use of tetracycline drugs.","List the two major bacterial pathogens responsible for anaplasmosis, their Gram staining, and their effects on red blood cells.",94.28571428571428,The two major bacterial pathogens responsible for anaplasmosis are Anaplasma marginale and Anaplasma phagocytophilum.

"The bulk of dried spaghetti is produced in factories using auger extruders. While essentially simple, the process requires attention to detail to ensure that the mixing and kneading of the ingredients produces a homogeneous mix, without air bubbles. The forming dies have to be water cooled to prevent spoiling of the pasta by overheating. Drying of the newly formed spaghetti has to be carefully controlled to prevent strands sticking together, and to leave it with sufficient moisture so that it is not too brittle.

"A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious or malignant disease. The safety and effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.","Based on the context, identify and describe the agent used in a vaccine and how it stimulates the immune system to provide active acquired immunity against a particular infectious or malignant disease.",94.28571428571428,"
The vaccine agent is usually a weakened or inactivated form of a disease-causing microbe, its toxin, or one of its surface proteins. Upon introduction to the body, this agent, referred to as an antigen, triggers an immune response. The immune system recognizes the antigen as foreign and responds by producing antibodies, which are proteins designed to neutralize or destroy the antigen. Once the body has produced these antibodies, it remembers how to produce them in the future, providing active acquired immunity against the specific infectious or malignant disease. This immunological memory enables the body to quickly and effectively respond to any subsequent encounters with the disease-causing microorganism or its toxins.",92.85714285714286,What is the use of a vaccine?,Vaccines can be used to provide immunity to a specific disease or infection.

Historically rare in urban areas, the Australian white ibis has established in urban areas of the east coast in increasing numbers since the late 1970s; it is now commonly seen in Wollongong, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide (where it mostly is in Mawson Lakes wetlands), Darwin, the Gold Coast, Brisbane and Townsville. In recent years, the bird has also become increasingly common in Perth, Western Australia, and surrounding towns in south-western Australia. Populations have disappeared from natural breeding areas such as the Macquarie Marshes in northern New South Wales. Management plans have been introduced to control problematic urban populations in Sydney.  Due to its increasing presence in the urban environment and its habit of rummaging in garbage, the species has acquired a variety of colloquial names such as ""tip turkey"" and ""bin chicken"", and in recent years has become an icon of Australia's popular culture, regarded with glee by some and passionate revulsion by others.","Instruction:

"Laika (/lak/ LY-k; Russian: , IPA: [lajk]; c.1954  3 November 1957) was a Soviet space dog who was one of the first animals in space and the first to orbit the Earth. A stray mongrel from the streets of Moscow, she flew aboard the Sputnik 2 spacecraft, launched into low orbit on 3 November 1957. As the technology to de-orbit had not yet been developed, Laika's survival was never expected. She died of overheating hours into the flight, on the craft's fourth orbit.  Little was known about the effects of spaceflight on living creatures at the time of Laika's mission, and animal flights were viewed by engineers as a necessary precursor to human missions. The experiment, which monitored Laika's vital signs, aimed to prove that a living organism could survive being launched into orbit and continue to function under conditions of weakened gravity and increased radiation, providing scientists with some of the first data on the biological effects of spaceflight.  Laika died within hours from overheating, possibly caused by a failure of the central R7 sustainer to separate from the payload. The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or, as the Soviet government initially claimed, she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion. In 2008, a small monument to Laika depicting her standing atop a rocket was unveiled near the military research facility in Moscow that prepared her flight.

The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions.

"Postmodernism is an intellectual stance or mode of discourse characterized by skepticism toward the ""grand narratives"" of modernism; rejection of epistemic certainty or the stability of meaning; and sensitivity to the role of ideology in maintaining political power. Claims to objectivity are dismissed as nave realism, with attention drawn to the conditional nature of knowledge claims within particular historical, political, and cultural discourses. The postmodern outlook is characterized by self-referentiality, epistemological relativism, moral relativism, pluralism, irony, irreverence, and eclecticism; it rejects the ""universal validity"" of binary oppositions, stable identity, hierarchy, and categorization  Initially emerging from a mode of literary criticism, postmodernism developed in the mid-twentieth century as a rejection of modernism, and has been observed across many disciplines. Postmodernism is associated with the disciplines deconstruction and post-structuralism. Various authors have criticized postmodernism as promoting obscurantism, as abandoning Enlightenment rationalism and scientific rigor, and as adding nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge","Based on the context, identify the specific aspects of postmodernism that reflect its rejection of modernist ""grand narratives"" and its emphasis on historical, political, and cultural discourses. What are the particular ways postmodernism challenges claims to epistemic certainty and the stability of meaning? How does postmodernism's outlook manifest self-referentiality, epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, irony, irreverence, and eclecticism? Additionally, describe how postmodernism, as presented in the context, has been criticized for promoting obscurantism, abandoning Enlightenment rationalism and scientific rigor, and not contributing to analytical or empirical knowledge.",92.14285714285714,"Postmodernism's rejection of modernist ""grand narratives"" is evident in its skepticism towards epistemic certainty and the stability of meaning. According to the context, postmodernism asserts that knowledge is not absolute but rather is shaped by historical, political, and cultural discourses. This perspective challenges the idea of objective truth and instead emphasizes the importance of understanding knowledge within its specific context.

Moreover, postmodernism's self-referentiality is reflected in its focus on the discourse itself, drawing attention to the role of language and the way meaning is constructed. Epistemological relativism is evident in the rejection of absolute truths, recognizing that knowledge is always provisional and subject to revision. Moral relativism, too, is a hallmark of postmodernism, which holds that moral judgments are relative to the historical, political, and cultural context in which they arise.

Pluralism is another aspect of postmodernism, as it accepts the existence of multiple perspectives and recognizes the value of diversity. Irony and irreverence are used to subvert dominant narratives and challenge established authority. Postmodernism's eclecticism is demonstrated by its willingness to incorporate diverse ideas and styles, drawing from a wide range of sources.

However, postmodernism has faced criticism for promoting obscurantism, abandoning Enlightenment rationalism and scientific rigor, and not contributing to analytical or empirical knowledge. Critics argue that postmodernism's rejection of grand narratives and absolute truths can lead to a lack of clarity and coherence, making it difficult to arrive at concrete conclusions or solutions to complex problems. Additionally, some argue that postmodernism's focus on language and discourse detracts from the importance of empirical evidence and objective analysis.",92.14285714285714,What is postmodernism?,"Postmodernism is a philosophical position that questions the certainty and immutability of human knowledge. It emerges in opposition to the main tenets of modernism and rejects claims of objective universal truths that are not bound and shaped by the social, historical, political and cultural context in which they arise. Postmodernist attitudes are characterized by moral relativism, a view where opposite moral precepts and world views are equally valid regardless of their consequences or scientific underpinning. This has led to criticism from thinkers that subscribe to rationalism and the notion that objective truths can be derived from scientific rigor."

"Waddell's career wound through a number of teams. He was notably unpredictable; early in his career, he once left in the middle of a game to go fishing. He also had a longstanding fascination with fire trucks and ran off the field to chase after them during games on multiple occasions. He would disappear for months at a time during the offseason, and it was not known where he went until it was discovered that he was wrestling alligators in a circus. He was easily distracted by opposing fans who held up puppies, which caused him to run over to play with them, and shiny objects, which seemed to put him in a trance. An alcoholic for much of his short life, he reportedly spent his entire first signing bonus on a drinking binge; as a pun of the baseball term ""southpaw"" denoting a left-handed pitcher, the Sporting News dubbed him a ""sousepaw"".

"The concept of the electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker. An electric field generally varies in space and its strength at any one point is defined as the force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, having both magnitude and direction, so it follows that an electric field is a vector field. The study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term 'lines of force' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines. Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.","Identify and describe the unique properties of the electric field that distinguish it from the gravitational field, specifically mentioning the direction of force and the possibility of attraction or repulsion, as outlined in the context.",90.0,"The electric field is distinguished from the gravitational field by its ability to result in either attraction or repulsion, unlike gravity which always acts in attraction. Additionally, the electric field can exert a force on a charged body in a direction that is opposite to its motion, whereas gravity always acts in the same direction as the motion of the masses.",92.14285714285714,What is electrostatics the study of?,The study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics.

"A glass ceiling is a metaphor usually applied to women, used to represent an invisible barrier that prevents a given demographic from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy. No matter how invisible the glass ceiling is expressed, it is actually a difficult obstacle to overcome. The metaphor was first used by feminists in reference to barriers in the careers of high-achieving women. It was coined by Marilyn Loden during a speech in 1978. In the United States, the concept is sometimes extended to refer to racial inequality in the United States. Minority women in white-majority countries often find the most difficulty in ""breaking the glass ceiling"" because they lie at the intersection of two historically marginalized groups: women and people of color. East Asian and East Asian American news outlets have coined the term ""bamboo ceiling"" to refer to the obstacles that all East Asian Americans face in advancing their careers. Similarly, a multitude of barriers that refugees and asylum seekers face in their search for meaningful employment is referred to as canvas ceiling.","Who coined the term ""glass ceiling"" and in what year?",95.71428571428572,"Marilyn Loden coined the term ""glass ceiling"" in 1978.",95.71428571428572,Why is the glass ceiling better for minority women?,"Actually, the glass ceiling is considered worse for minority women, not better.

"One of the driest places on Earth is the Atacama Desert. It is virtually devoid of life because it is blocked from receiving precipitation by the Andes mountains to the east and the Chilean Coast Range to the west. The cold Humboldt Current and the anticyclone of the Pacific are essential to keep the dry climate of the Atacama. The average precipitation in the Chilean region of Antofagasta is just 1 mm (0.039 in) per year. Some weather stations in the Atacama have never received rain. Evidence suggests that the Atacama may not have had any significant rainfall from 1570 to 1971. It is so arid that mountains that reach as high as 6,885 m (22,589 ft) are completely free of glaciers and, in the southern part from 25S to 27S, may have been glacier-free throughout the Quaternary, though permafrost extends down to an altitude of 4,400 m (14,400 ft) and is continuous above 5,600 m (18,400 ft).

"Old French (franceis, franois, romanz; Modern French: ancien franais) was the language spoken in most of the northern half of France from approximately the 8th to the 14th centuries. Rather than a unified language, Old French was a linkage of Romance dialects, mutually intelligible yet diverse, spoken in the northern half of France. These dialects came to be collectively known as the langue d'ol, contrasting with the langue d'oc in the south of France. The mid-14th century witnessed the emergence of Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance in the le de France region; this dialect was a predecessor to Modern French. Other dialects of Old French evolved themselves into modern forms (Poitevin-Saintongeais, Gallo, Norman, Picard, Walloon, etc.), each with its own linguistic features and history.","What were the two main dialect groups of Old French, and what was the collective name given to the dialects spoken in the northern half of France, in contrast to those in the south?",92.14285714285714,"The two main dialect groups of Old French were the langue d'oc and the langue d'oïl.

"Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons or protons). The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of energy. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in nuclear binding energy between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers active or main-sequence stars and other high-magnitude stars, where large amounts of energy are released.  A nuclear fusion process that produces atomic nuclei lighter than iron-56 or nickel-62 will generally release energy. These elements have a relatively small mass and a relatively large binding energy per nucleon. Fusion of nuclei lighter than these releases energy (an exothermic process), while the fusion of heavier nuclei results in energy retained by the product nucleons, and the resulting reaction is endothermic. The opposite is true for the reverse process, called nuclear fission. Nuclear fusion uses lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, which are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as uranium, thorium and plutonium, are more fissionable. The extreme astrophysical event of a supernova can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into elements heavier than iron.","What are the specific conditions that make nuclear fusion of lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, an exothermic process, releasing energy?",92.14285714285714,"Nuclear fusion of lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, is an exothermic process, releasing energy, due to the difference in nuclear binding energy between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction.

"There has been much speculation over the functions of Triceratops' head adornments. The two main theories have revolved around use in combat and in courtship display, with the latter now thought to be the most likely primary function.  Early on, Lull postulated that the frills may have served as anchor points for the jaw muscles to aid chewing by allowing increased size and thus power for the muscles. This has been put forward by other authors over the years, but later studies do not find evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.  Triceratops were long thought to have used their horns and frills in combat with predators such as Tyrannosaurus, the idea being discussed first by Charles H. Sternberg in 1917 and 70 years later by Robert Bakker. There is evidence that Tyrannosaurus did have aggressive head-on encounters with Triceratops, based on partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal; the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. Which animal was the aggressor is not known. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that in a battle against a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns. Tyrannosaurus is also known to have fed on Triceratops, as shown by a heavily tooth-scored Triceratops ilium and sacrum.","What specific features of the Triceratops' head adornments, including its horns and frills, could it have used to defend itself and inflict fatal wounds on a Tyrannosaurus in a hypothetical battle, according to the provided context?",93.57142857142856,"Based on the context provided, the Triceratops' head adornments, specifically its horns and frills, could have been used as defensive and offensive weapons in a hypothetical battle against a Tyrannosaurus.

The evidence suggests that Tyrannosaurus did engage in aggressive head-on encounters with Triceratops, as indicated by tooth marks and bone growth on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal. In such a scenario, the Triceratops' sharp and likely substantial horns could have been used to inflict fatal wounds on the Tyrannosaurus, as estimated by paleontologist Peter Dodson.

Jurong Island, Pulau Tekong, Pulau Ubin and Sentosa are the largest of Singapore's smaller islands. The highest natural point is Bukit Timah Hill at 163.63 m (537 ft). Under British rule, Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands were part of Singapore, and both were transferred to Australia in 1957. Pedra Branca is the nation's easternmost point.

The country is projected to reclaim another 56 km2 (20 sq mi). Some projects involve merging smaller islands through land reclamation to form larger, more functional and habitable islands, as has been done with Jurong Island. The type of sand used in reclamation is found in rivers and beaches, rather than deserts, and is in great demand worldwide. In 2010 Singapore imported almost 15 million tons of sand for its projects, the demand being such that Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam have all restricted or barred the export of sand to Singapore in recent years.

"The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is an American single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the United States Air Force (USAF). As the result of the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, the aircraft was designed as an air superiority fighter, but also has ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities. The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22's airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems.  The aircraft first flew in 1997 and was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. Although the USAF had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs, the program was cut to 187 operational aircraft in 2009 due to high costs, a lack of air-to-air missions at the time of production, and the development of the more affordable and versatile F-35.[N 1] The last F-22 was delivered in 2012.  While it had a protracted development and initial operational difficulties, the F-22 has become a critical component of the USAF's tactical airpower. The fighter's combination of stealth, aerodynamic performance, and mission systems enabled a leap in air combat capabilities and set the benchmark for its generation.

"Frank Lloyd Wright (June 8, 1867  April 9, 1959) was an American architect, designer, writer, and educator.  He designed more than 1,000 structures over a creative period of 70 years. Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship. Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater (1935), which has been called ""the best all-time work of American architecture"".  Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture and also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City, his vision for urban planning in the United States. He also designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and other commercial projects. Wright-designed interior elements (including leaded glass windows, floors, furniture and even tableware) were integrated into these structures. He wrote several books and numerous articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as ""the greatest American architect of all time"". In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright.  Raised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin and then apprenticed in Chicago, briefly with Joseph Lyman Silsbee, and then with Louis Sullivan at Adler & Sullivan. Wright opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893 and established a studio in his Oak Park, Illinois home in 1898. His fame increased and his personal life sometimes made headlines: leaving his first wife Catherine Tobin for Mamah Cheney in 1909; the murder of Mamah and her children and others at his Taliesin estate by a staff member in 1914; his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel (m. 19231927); and his courtship and marriage with Olgivanna Lazovi (m. 19281959).","What was the name of the architectural movement that Frank Lloyd Wright pioneered, and what was the name of the city where he developed the concept of the Usonian home?",94.28571428571428,Frank Lloyd Wright pioneered the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City.,94.28571428571428,"Who is Frank Lloyd Wright, and why is he famous?",Frank Lloyd Wright continues to be an inspiration in architecture around the United States and many of his originally designed buildings and structures stand today.

"According to the Global Competitiveness Report of 2019, Morocco Ranked 32nd in the world in terms of Roads, 16th in Sea, 45th in Air and 64th in Railways. This gives Morocco the best infrastructure rankings in the African continent.  Modern infrastructure development, such as ports, airports, and rail links, is a top government priority. To meet the growing domestic demand, the Moroccan government invested more than $15 billion from 2010 to 2015 in upgrading its basic infrastructure.  Morocco has one of the best road systems on the continent. Over the past 20 years, the government has built approximately 1770 kilometers of modern roads, connecting most major cities via toll expressways.

"The U.S. Space Force traces its roots to the beginning of the Cold War, with the first Army Air Forces space programs starting in 1945. In 1954, the Western Development Division, under General Bernard Schriever, was established as the first dedicated space organization within the U.S. Armed Forces and continues to exist as the Space Force's Space and Missile Systems Center. Military space forces were organized under several different Air Force major commands until they were unified when Air Force Space Command was established on 1 September 1982. U.S. space forces first began conducting combat support operations in the Vietnam War and continued to provide satellite communications, weather, and navigation support during the 1982 Falklands War, 1983 United States invasion of Grenada, 1986 United States bombing of Libya, and 1989 United States invasion of Panama. The first major employment of space forces culminated in the Gulf War, where they proved so critical to the U.S.-led coalition that it is sometimes referred to as the first ""space war"".  The first discussions of creating a military space service occurred in 1958, and it was nearly established in 1982 by President Ronald Reagan as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative, but the idea dissolved with treaty compliance concerns.

These conflicts include the Vietnam War, the 1982 Falklands War, the 1983 United States invasion of Grenada, the 1986 United States bombing of Libya, and the 1989 United States invasion of Panama. Specifically, in the Vietnam War, space forces were among the first to conduct combat support operations, while in subsequent conflicts, they primarily offered satellite communications, weather, and navigation support.

In the 1982 Falklands War, U.S. space forces continued to provide satellite communications, ensuring effective communication between coalition forces. During the 1983 United States invasion of Grenada, they offered critical weather data, enabling more accurate assessments and planning for ground operations. In the 1986 United States bombing of Libya, space forces provided vital satellite communications and navigation support, allowing for more precise targeting and execution of airstrikes. Lastly, in the 1989 United States invasion of Panama, space forces once again proved indispensable, offering essential satellite communications and navigation support to the U.S.-led coalition.

These contributions were most notably demonstrated during the Gulf War, where U.S. space forces proved so critical that the conflict is sometimes referred to as the first ""space war."" Despite earlier attempts to establish a military space service in the 1950s and 1980s, it wasn't until 2019 that the United States Space Force was officially created, solidifying the role of space forces as an independent military service.",94.28571428571428,"From the passage below, please extract the official starting date of the United States Space Force.","The United States Space Force Act was signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act on December 20, 2019.

"Persea americana, or the avocado, possibly originated in the Tehuacan Valley in the state of Puebla, Mexico, although fossil evidence suggests similar species were much more widespread millions of years ago. However, there is evidence for three possible separate domestications of the avocado, resulting in the currently recognized Mexican (aoacatl), Guatemalan (quilaoacatl), and West Indian (tlacacolaocatl) landraces. The Mexican and Guatemalan landraces originated in the highlands of those countries, while the West Indian landrace is a lowland variety that ranges from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador to Peru, achieving a wide range through human agency before the arrival of the Europeans. The three separate landraces were most likely to have already intermingled in pre-Columbian America and were described in the Florentine Codex.  The earliest residents of northern coastal Peru were living in temporary camps in an ancient wetland and eating avocados, along with chilies, mollusks, sharks, birds, and sea lions. The oldest discovery of an avocado pit comes from Coxcatlan Cave, dating from around 9,000 to 10,000 years ago. Other caves in the Tehuacan Valley from around the same time period also show early evidence for the presence and consumption of avocado.

"Tendulkar scored 143 (131) runs in Sharjah against the Australian team in the 1998 Coca-Cola cup, including 5 sixes in an inning against Shane Warne, Damien Fleming and Michael Kasprowicz. The inning is known as the ""Desert Storm"" because it was interrupted by a sand storm. In 2020, a poll from the ICC declared it Tendulkar's best ODI inning.  In early 1998, while playing in an Australian tour of India, Tendulkar scored three consecutive centuries. The focus of the tour was the clash between Tendulkar and spinner Shane Warne, both at the peak of their careers. In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan. In their tour opener, Australia faced Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match. Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 204 runs as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days. He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs. The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjahthe first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings. Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.

2. Terrain: The site's topography, such as slopes, drainage patterns, and natural contours, can significantly impact landscaping decisions, including the selection of plants and hardscapes.
3. Soil qualities: Soil composition, pH level, drainage, and texture are essential factors in choosing plants and designing irrigation systems.
4. Prevailing winds: Wind patterns can influence the placement of trees, shrubs, and other vegetation, as well as the design of structures and hardscapes.
5. Depth of the frost line: The frost line depth determines the minimum depth at which plants can be planted to survive the winter frost. This information is vital for selecting suitable vegetation and planning landscaping features.
6. Native flora and fauna: The native plant species and wildlife in the area can provide inspiration for landscaping designs, as well as help maintain ecological balance and support local ecosystems.

Although his father wanted him to enlist, the younger Liautaud chose the latter, and his father agreed to loan him $25,000 in exchange for a 48% stake in the business. Initially Jimmy John wanted to open a hot dog stand, but after visiting numerous such stands throughout the summer of 1982, he realized the $25,000 would not be enough for such a venture. After a chance encounter at a sandwich shop, Jimmy John realized that he could open a sandwich shop within his available budget by purchasing premium meats at a neighborhood market and baking his own bread. With the help of his family as tasters, he decided to put four sandwiches on his original menu. Paying $200 a month in rent, Liautaud could only afford used equipment consisting of a refrigerator, a chest freezer, an oven, and a meat slicer.  On January 13, 1983, Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches opened in Charleston, Illinois.

"The peanut (Arachis hypogaea), also known as the groundnut, goober, pindar or monkey nut (UK), is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds. It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics, important to both small and large commercial producers. It is classified as both a grain legume and, due to its high oil content, an oil crop. World annual production of shelled peanuts was 44 million tonnes in 2016, led by China with 38% of the world total. Atypically among legume crop plants, peanut pods develop underground (geocarpy) rather than above ground. With this characteristic in mind, the botanist Carl Linnaeus gave peanuts the specific epithet hypogaea, which means ""under the earth"".  The peanut belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae), commonly known as the legume, bean, or pea family. Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules. The capacity to fix nitrogen means peanuts require less nitrogen-containing fertilizer and improve soil fertility, making them valuable in crop rotations.  Peanuts are similar in taste and nutritional profile to tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds, and, as a culinary nut, are often served in similar ways in Western cuisines. The botanical definition of a nut is ""a fruit whose ovary wall becomes hard at maturity."" Using this criterion, the peanut is not a nut. However, peanuts are usually categorized as nuts for culinary purposes and in common English more generally.","What is the specific epithet given to peanuts by Carl Linnaeus, and what does it mean?",94.28571428571428,"The specific epithet given to peanuts by Carl Linnaeus is hypogaea, which means ""under the earth"".",94.28571428571428,"Based on this text, would it be correct to say a peanut is a nut?","This article describes different ways to classify a peanut.

"A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.","What are the three essential components found in each block of a blockchain, and how do they contribute to the blockchain's security and irreversibility?",95.0,"Each block of a blockchain contains three essential components: a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (represented as a Merkle tree).

Some physicists say the multiverse is not a legitimate topic of scientific inquiry. Concerns have been raised about whether attempts to exempt the multiverse from experimental verification could erode public confidence in science and ultimately damage the study of fundamental physics. Some have argued that the multiverse is a philosophical notion rather than a scientific hypothesis because it cannot be empirically falsified. The ability to disprove a theory by means of scientific experiment is a critical criterion of the accepted scientific method.

"The best approach to specifically achieve muscle growth remains controversial (as opposed to focusing on gaining strength, power, or endurance); it was generally considered that consistent anaerobic strength training will produce hypertrophy over the long term, in addition to its effects on muscular strength and endurance. Muscular hypertrophy can be increased through strength training and other short-duration, high-intensity anaerobic exercises. Lower-intensity, longer-duration aerobic exercise generally does not result in very effective tissue hypertrophy; instead, endurance athletes enhance storage of fats and carbohydrates within the muscles, as well as neovascularization.",What types of anaerobic exercises have been linked to increasing muscular hypertrophy over the long term?,94.28571428571428,"Based on the context, consistent anaerobic strength training, such as weightlifting or resistance band exercises, and short-duration, high-intensity anaerobic exercises like sprint intervals, jump squats, or burpees, have been scientifically proven to effectively promote muscular hypertrophy in the long term.

"The Dom Tower (Cathedral Tower, Dutch: Domtoren) of Utrecht is the tallest church tower in the Netherlands, at 112.5 metres (368 feet) in height. It is considered the symbol of Utrecht. The tower was part of St. Martin's Cathedral, also known as the Dom Church, and was built between 1321 and 1382, to a design by John of Hainaut. The cathedral was never fully completed due to lack of money. Since the unfinished nave collapsed in 1674, the Dom tower has been a freestanding tower. The tower stands at the spot where the city of Utrecht originated almost 2,000 years ago.  Design and construction The Dom Tower was one of the largest towers constructed in Europe during the fourteenth century, and it was planned to show the power of the church in Utrecht.[citation needed] Its construction led preacher Geert Groote to protest against the vanity of such an immense project, suggesting it was too tall, too expensive and all but aesthetic.  The tower consists of two square blocks, topped by a much lighter lantern. One of the most striking features is the absence of visible buttresses. Its particular shape and original architecture had a large influence on many other towers in the Netherlands, including the Martinitoren in Groningen.[citation needed] Upon completion in 1382 the tower stood 109 metres tall. However the height was increased during the restorations in 1910, to its present height of 112.5 metres.  The Dom tower was a multifunctional building. In addition to being a belfry, it contained a private chapel of the Bishop of Utrecht on the first floor. It also served as a watchtower; the tower guard was housed on the second floor of the lower square block.","What is the original height, in meters, of the Dom Tower when it was completed in 1382?",94.28571428571428,109 metres.,95.71428571428572,"Given these paragraphs about Natural hydrogen, what is another name for it that distinguishes from other forms of hydrogen?",White hydrogen

"Online conversion rate optimization (or website optimization) was born out of the need of e-commerce marketers to improve their website's performance in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, when technology companies started to be more aware about their spending, investing more in website analytics. After the burst, with website creation being more accessible, tons of pages with bad user experience were created. As competition grew on the web during the early 2000s, website analysis tools became available, and awareness of website usability grew, internet marketers were prompted to produce measurables for their tactics and improve their website's user experience.  In 2004, new tools enabled internet marketers to experiment with website design and content variations to determine which layouts, copy text, offers, and images perform best. Testing started to be more accessible and known. This form of optimization accelerated in 2007 with the introduction of the free tool Google Website Optimizer. Today, optimization and conversion are key aspects of many digital marketing campaigns. A research study conducted among internet marketers in 2017, for example, showed that 50% of respondents thought that CRO was ""crucial to their overall digital marketing strategy"".  Conversion rate optimization shares many principles with direct response marketing  a marketing approach that emphasizes tracking, testing, and on-going improvement. Direct marketing was popularized in the early twentieth century and supported by the formation of industry groups such as the Direct Marketing Association, which was formed in 1917 and later named Data & Marketing Association and acquired by the Association of National Advertisers following the announcement on May 31, 2018.  Like modern day conversion rate optimization, direct response marketers also practice A/B split-testing, response tracking, and audience testing to optimize mail, radio, and print campaigns.","What year saw the introduction of the free tool Google Website Optimizer, which accelerated conversion rate optimization?",90.0,2007.,88.57142857142857,"From the passage provided, extract where Thomas finished high school.","Thomas finished high school at John Muir High School in Pasadena, California."

From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.

Postures are held for a relatively long period of time compared to other schools of yoga; this allows the muscles to relax and lengthen, and encourages awareness in the pose.

"Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[citation not found] particularly for clientserver web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.  Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

"Foley first described the use of a self-retaining balloon catheter in 1929, to be used to achieve hemostasis after cystoscopic prostatectomy. He worked on development of this design for use as an indwelling urinary catheter, to provide continuous drainage of the bladder, in the 1930s. His design incorporated an inflatable balloon towards the tip of the tube which could be inflated inside the bladder to retain the catheter without external taping or strapping. He demonstrated this to the American Urologists Society in 1935, and published a paper describing it in 1937. While he was still developing his catheter, a patent was issued to Paul Raiche of the Davol Rubber Company of Providence, Rhode Island in 1936. Four months later, in October 1936, Foley applied for the patent, and was awarded this after appearing before the patent office Board of Appeals. Raiche appealed this decision in court, and it was overturned, returning the patent to Raiche.

Construction started in 1967, with the company instead building a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning the experimental concepts for a planned community. The Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex, in 1971, followed by Epcot (1982), Disney's Hollywood Studios (1989), and Disney's Animal Kingdom (1998).

"Magnesium is a chemical element with the symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray metal having a low density, low melting point and high chemical reactivity. Like the other alkaline earth metals (group 2 of the periodic table) it occurs naturally only in combination with other elements and it almost always has an oxidation state of +2. It reacts readily with air to form a thin passivation coating of magnesium oxide that inhibits further corrosion of the metal. The free metal burns with a brilliant-white light. The metal is obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine. It is less dense than aluminium and is used primarily as a component in strong and lightweight alloys that contain aluminium.","Identify the three specific characteristics of magnesium described in the context that contribute to its unique properties and applications.

"Academic literature uses the abstract to succinctly communicate complex research. An abstract may act as a stand-alone entity instead of a full paper. As such, an abstract is used by many organizations as the basis for selecting research that is proposed for presentation in the form of a poster, platform/oral presentation or workshop presentation at an academic conference. Most bibliographic databases only index abstracts rather than providing the entire text of the paper. Full texts of scientific papers must often be purchased because of copyright and/or publisher fees and therefore the abstract is a significant selling point for the reprint or electronic form of the full text. The abstract can convey the main results and conclusions of a scientific article but the full text article must be consulted for details of the methodology, the full experimental results, and a critical discussion of the interpretations and conclusions. An abstract allows one to sift through copious numbers of papers for ones in which the researcher can have more confidence that they will be relevant to their research. Once papers are chosen based on the abstract, they must be read carefully to be evaluated for relevance. It is generally agreed that one must not base reference citations on the abstract alone, but the content of an entire paper.","What are the primary differences between the information conveyed in an abstract and the full text of a scientific paper, and how do these differences impact the researcher's ability to evaluate relevance and make reference citations?",92.14285714285714,"The primary differences between an abstract and the full text of a scientific paper are the level of detail and scope.

Individuals with SPD may inadequately process visual, auditory, olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), tactile (touch), vestibular (balance), proprioception (body awareness), and interoception (internal body senses) sensory stimuli.  Sensory integration was defined by occupational therapist Anna Jean Ayres in 1972 as ""the neurological process that organizes sensation from one's own body and from the environment and makes it possible to use the body effectively within the environment"".Sensory processing disorder has been characterized as the source of significant problems in organizing sensation coming from the body and the environment and is manifested by difficulties in the performance in one or more of the main areas of life: productivity, leisure and play or activities of daily living. Sources debate whether SPD is an independent disorder or represents the observed symptoms of various other, more well-established, disorders.SPD is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended in 2012 that pediatricians not use SPD as a stand-alone diagnosis.","Instruction: Based on the context, identify the specific life domains where individuals with sensory processing disorder may encounter challenges in organizing sensation and performing related tasks.",94.28571428571428,"Individuals with sensory processing disorder may encounter challenges in organizing sensation and performing related tasks in three main life domains: productivity, leisure and play, and activities of daily living.

"Cloud Gate is a public sculpture by Indian-born British artist Anish Kapoor, that is the centerpiece of AT&T Plaza at Millennium Park in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois. The sculpture and AT&T Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed ""The Bean"" because of its shape, a name Kapoor initially disliked, but later grew fond of. Made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13 m), and weighs 110 short tons (100 t; 98 long tons).  Kapoor's design was inspired by liquid mercury and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's 12-foot (3.7 m) high arch.

"Modern snowboarding was pioneered by Tom Sims and Jake Burton Carpenter, who both contributed significant innovations and started influential companies. In February 1968, Poppen organized the first snurfing competition at a Michigan ski resort that attracted enthusiasts from all over the country. One of those early pioneers was Tom Sims, a devotee of skateboarding (a sport born in the 1950s when kids attached roller skate wheels to small boards that they steered by shifting their weight). In the 1960s, as an eighth grader in Haddonfield, New Jersey, Sims crafted a snowboard in his school shop class by gluing carpet to the top of a piece of wood and attaching aluminum sheeting to the bottom. He produced commercial snowboards in the mid-70s. Others experimented with board-on-snow configurations at this time, including Welsh skateboard enthusiasts Jon Roberts and Pete Matthews developed their own snowboards to use at their local dry ski slope.",Who were the two pioneers who contributed significant innovations and started influential companies in modern snowboarding?,94.28571428571428,Tom Sims and Jake Burton Carpenter.,94.28571428571428,Give me a summary of the early history of snowboarding,"In the early days snowboarding was founded by Tom Sims and Jake Burton.

"Figure skating is a sport in which individuals, pairs, or groups perform on figure skates on ice. It was the first winter sport to be included in the Olympic Games, when contested at the 1908 Olympics in London. The Olympic disciplines are men's singles, women's singles,[note 1] pair skating, and ice dance; the four individual disciplines are also combined into a team event, first included in the Winter Olympics in 2014. The non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating, Theater on Ice, and four skating. From intermediate through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs (the short program and the free skate), which, depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps, death spirals, and other elements or moves.  Figure skaters compete at various levels from beginner up to the Olympic level (senior) at local, regional, sectional, national, and international competitions. The International Skating Union (ISU) regulates international figure skating judging and competitions. These include the Winter Olympics, the World Championships, the World Junior Championships, the European Championships, the Four Continents Championships, the Grand Prix series (senior and junior), and the ISU Challenger Series.  The sport is also associated with show business. Major competitions generally conclude with exhibition galas, in which the top skaters from each discipline perform non-competitive programs. Many skaters, both during and after their competitive careers, also skate in ice shows, which run during the competitive season and the off-season.","What are the four individual Olympic disciplines in figure skating, and how are they combined into a team event?",94.28571428571428,"The four individual Olympic disciplines in figure skating are men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dance.

The primary resources they seek include:

1. Food: Nomads require a consistent supply of nourishment to sustain themselves and their livestock. They search for edible plants, fruits, and animals to hunt or herd.
2. Water: Access to clean water is crucial for both nomads and their livestock. They follow water sources, such as rivers, lakes, or underground springs, to ensure their survival.
3. Grazing land: Nomads, particularly those who rely on livestock, need sufficient space for their herds to graze. They search for areas with abundant vegetation to support their livestock's dietary needs.

Therefore, nomads' movements are primarily driven by the need to locate and secure these three essential resources: food, water, and grazing land.",94.28571428571428,"What is the meaning of ""tidal coupling""?","Tidal coupling or synchronous rotation is what causes one astronomical object's face to be fixed pointing to another, just as the Moon's visible face is always pointing to the Earth. A coupled object takes the same amount of time to rotate about its axis as it does to translate around its companion. This synchronous rotation, also known as captured rotation or synchronous rotation, causes one hemisphere to point continuously toward the companion object. Normally, only the satellite couples around a larger planet, but if the mass difference between the two bodies and the distance between them is small, both objects may have a reciprocal tidal coupling, as Pluto and Charon do."
"On March 27, 2023, a mass shooting occurred at The Covenant School, a private Presbyterian Church in America parochial school in the Green Hills neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee. Local resident and former student of the school Aiden Hale (formerly Audrey Elizabeth Hale) killed three children and three adults. Hale, 28, was killed by two Metropolitan Nashville Police Department officers responding to the incident.  Hale was initially reported to be a woman and referred to by his birth name by police. Later, it was confirmed that Hale was a trans man who went by the name Aiden and used he/him pronouns.  Hale drove a Honda Fit to the school, arriving at 9:54 a.m. CDT and parking it in the lot. At 9:57, Hale sent an Instagram message to an old friend saying an earlier post he made was ""basically a suicide note"" and that he planned to die that day. His friend called a crisis hotline before contacting the Davidson County Sheriff's Office at 10:13.  At 10:11, Hale shot through a set of glass side doors and entered the building. He was armed with two rifles and a pistol. At 10:13, police received a call about an active shooter. He walked across the second floor of the school before opening fire. He fired into several classrooms; no one in the classrooms was injured because the teachers had fortified doors and sheltered the students. The police first arrived at the school at 10:24. A teacher told an officer that the students were in lockdown and two were missing.  Officers entered the building at 10:25 and they searched each room for Hale. They heard gunshots coming from the second floor. Five Metro Nashville police officers went upstairs and saw him in a lobby area, firing through a window at arriving police vehicles.

"Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.  Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, followed by helium, which constitutes a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since at least 1831.  Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere. The planet's magnetic tail is nearly 800 million kilometres (5.3 astronomical units; 500 million miles) long. Jupiter has 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's moon.  Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet in December 1973. Jupiter has since been explored by multiple robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979. The Galileo orbiter arrived in orbit around Jupiter in 1995. In 2007, New Horizons visited Jupiter for a gravity assist to increase its speed and bend its trajectory on the way to Pluto. The latest probe to visit Jupiter, Juno, entered its orbit in July 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include its moon Europa, which probably has an ice-covered liquid ocean which scientists think could sustain life.","What is the primary composition of Jupiter, and what percentage of its mass and volume does helium constitute?",94.28571428571428,"Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System, is primarily composed of hydrogen.

"Chichn Itz (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archeological site is located in Tinm Municipality, Yucatn State, Mexico.  Chichn Itz was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 9001200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.  Chichn Itz was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.  The ruins of Chichn Itz are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropologa e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatn.  Chichn Itz is one of the most visited archeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.","What architectural styles at Chichn Itz are reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico, and which styles are characteristic of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands?",94.28571428571428,"Chichn Itz is distinguished by a fusion of architectural styles, some of which bear resemblance to those found in central Mexico, while others are typical of the Puuc and Chenes styles prevalent in the Northern Maya lowlands.

The Puuc style, characterized by its corbeled arches, stepped pyramids, and ornate carvings, is evident in structures like the Temple of the Warriors and the Temple of the Thousand Columns.

"Artificial neural networks (ANNs), usually simply called neural networks (NNs) or neural nets, are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron receives signals then processes them and can signal neurons connected to it. The ""signal"" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called edges. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. utomatically generate identifying characteristics from the examples that they process.Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.","What are the three main components that make up an artificial neuron in an ANN, as described in the context?",90.0,"An artificial neuron in an ANN consists of three main components: connections or edges, which transmit signals to other neurons; weights, which adjust the strength of the signal at a connection as learning proceeds; and a non-linear function, which computes the output of the neuron based on the sum of its inputs.",95.71428571428572,What are artificial neural networks?,Neural networks are computer systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains

"In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that any distributed data store can provide only two of the following three guarantees:  Consistency Every read receives the most recent write or an error. Availability Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write. Partition tolerance The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes. When a network partition failure happens, it must be decided whether to do one of the following:  cancel the operation and thus decrease the availability but ensure consistency proceed with the operation and thus provide availability but risk inconsistency.  Thus, if there is a network partition, one has to choose between consistency or availability. Note that consistency as defined in the CAP theorem is quite different from the consistency guaranteed in ACID database transactions.  Eric Brewer argues that the often-used ""two out of three"" concept can be somewhat misleading because system designers need only to sacrifice consistency or availability in the presence of partitions, but that in many systems partitions are rare.","Given the context, identify the situation where a network partition occurs in a distributed data store and describe the trade-off between consistency and availability that must be made:

In the context of a distributed data store, when a network partition occurs, the system can only guarantee two of the following:

2. Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
3. Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.

When a network partition failure happens, it is necessary to decide whether to:

a) cancel the operation, ensuring consistency but decreasing availability, or
b) proceed with the operation, providing availability but risking inconsistency.

Therefore, in the presence of a network partition, one must choose between prioritizing consistency or availability. Keep in mind that consistency as defined in the CAP theorem is different from the consistency guaranteed in ACID database transactions.

"Prince of Persia is a video game franchise created by Jordan Mechner. It is built around a series of action-adventure games focused on various incarnations of the eponymous Prince, set in ancient and medieval Persia.  The first two games in the series, Prince of Persia (1989) and Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame (1993), were published by Broderbund. Prince of Persia 3D (1999), named for being the first installment to use 3D computer graphics, was developed by Red Orb Entertainment and published by The Learning Company on PC; The Dreamcast version was developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive. Ubisoft bought the rights to the franchise in 2001 and rebooted it with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003). Ubisoft has since developed and published four additional entries in the series: Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2006), Prince of Persia (2008), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010), as well as a number of spin-offs and games for mobile devices.  Outside of the games, the franchise also includes a film adaptation based on The Sands of Time, written in part by Mechner, and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2010; a graphic novel; and the Lego Prince of Persia toyline.

"Gabriel Jos de la Concordia Garca Mrquez (American Spanish: [ajel asi.a makes] (listen); 6 March 1927  17 April 2014) was a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter, and journalist, known affectionately as Gabo ([ao]) or Gabito ([aito]) throughout Latin America. Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, particularly in the Spanish language, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in leaving law school for a career in journalism. From early on he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha Pardo; they had two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo.  Garca Mrquez started as a journalist and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), Chronicle of a Death Foretold (1981), and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style known as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations.

"Ferrets spend 1418 hours a day asleep and are most active around the hours of dawn and dusk, meaning they are crepuscular. If they are caged, they should be taken out daily to exercise and satisfy their curiosity; they need at least an hour and a place to play.

1. Exercise and Curiosity Satisfaction: Since ferrets are crepuscular animals, they are most active around dawn and dusk. Therefore, they should be taken out of their cages daily for at least an hour to explore and satisfy their curiosity.
2. Playtime: Ferrets need a suitable place to play, as they are known for their high energy levels and love for exploration. A ferret-proofed area for play and exercise is essential to ensure their safety and provide mental stimulation.
3. Enclosed Sleeping Space: Ferrets sleep for approximately 1418 hours a day. They prefer an enclosed, burrow-like sleeping area to feel secure and comfortable. A minimum of one hour of enclosed space should be made available, with a large enough enclosure for them to move around comfortably.
4. Social Needs: Unlike their solitary polecat ancestors, most ferrets live happily in social groups. Keeping them with other ferrets will help meet their social needs and reduce stress. Providing mental stimulation and enrichment activities, such as hiding treats or toys, can also keep them engaged and prevent boredom.

"Ludwig van Beethoven[n 1] (baptised 17 December 1770  26 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers in the history of Western music; his works rank among the most performed of the classical music repertoire and span the transition from the Classical period to the Romantic era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. His early period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed an individual development from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterized as heroic. During this time, he began to grow increasingly deaf. In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.","Based on the context, identify the specific time frames for each of Beethoven's musical periods:

Ludwig van Beethoven's musical career is conventionally divided into three periods: early, middle, and late. His early period, during which he developed his craft, spanned from his baptism in 1770 to 1802. This period saw Beethoven learning from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, laying the foundation for his future compositional endeavors.

His middle period, characterized by individual development and often referred to as heroic, began around 1802 and lasted until approximately 1812. During this time, Beethoven began to grow increasingly deaf, but he continued to push the boundaries of classical music, experimenting with new forms and expressions. This period marked a significant departure from his earlier influences, as Beethoven began to forge his unique style.

In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, Beethoven extended his innovations in musical form and expression, producing pioneering works that significantly contributed to the transition from the Classical to the Romantic era in classical music. Despite his increasing deafness, Beethoven continued to compose some of his most iconic works, including his symphonies and piano sonatas.",94.28571428571428,Who was Beethoven?,Beethoven was a German composer and pianist known for his famous symphonies such as Moonlight Sonata.
"In West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy's increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British West Africa Squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.  Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against ""the usurping King of Lagos"", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers. The largest powers of West Africa (the Asante Confederacy, the Kingdom of Dahomey, and the Oyo Empire) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of ""legitimate commerce"" in the form of palm oil, cocoa, timber and gold, forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade.

Palm oil became a major export for the Asante Confederacy, with its abundant resources and high demand in Europe for use in the manufacture of soap and margarine. The Kingdom of Dahomey, on the other hand, placed significant emphasis on cocoa production, which would later become a staple crop in West Africa's modern export trade.

"After listening to a talk by biologist David Baltimore and further stimulation from his virologist colleague, Robert Ting, concerning the work of the late Howard Martin Temin, Gallo became interested in the study of retroviruses, and made their study the primary activity of his lab. In 1976, Doris Morgan, a first year post-doctoral fellow in Gallo's lab, was asked by Gallo to examine culture fluid of activated lymphocytes for the possible production of growth factors. Soon she was successful in growing T lymphocytes. Gallo, Morgan and Frank Ruscetti, another researcher in Gallo's lab, coauthored a paper in Science describing their method. The Gallo group identified this as T-cell growth factor (TCGF). The name was changed in 1978 to IL-2 (interleukin-2) by the Second International Lymphokine Conference (which was held in Interlaken, Switzerland). Although earlier reports had described soluble molecules with biologic effects, the effects and biochemistry of the factors were not well characterized. One such example was the report by Julius Gordon in 1965, which described blastogenic transformation of lymphocytes in extracellular media. However, cell growth was not demonstrated and the affected cell type was not identified, making the identity of the factor(s) involved unclear and its natural function unknown. The discovery of IL-2 allowed T cells, previously thought to be dead end cells, to be grown significantly in culture for the first time, opening research into many aspects of T cell immunology. Gallo's lab later purified and biochemically characterized IL-2. This breakthrough also allowed researchers to grow T-cells and study the viruses that affect them, such as human T-cell leukemia virus, or HTLV, the first retrovirus identified in humans, which Bernard Poiesz, another post-doctoral fellow in Gallo's lab played a key role in its isolation. HTLV's role in leukemia was clarified when Kiyoshi Takatsuki and other Japanese researchers, puzzling over an outbreak of a rare form of leukemia, later independently found the same retrovirus, and both groups showed HTLV to be the cause. At the same time, a similar HTLV-associated leukemia was identified by the Gallo group in the Caribbean.

"The Blasket Islands (Irish: Na Blascaoda) are an uninhabited group of islands off the west coast of the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland. The last island to hold a significant population, Great Blasket Island, was abandoned in 1954 due to population decline and is best known for a number of gifted Irish language writers who vividly described their way of life and who kept alive old Irish folk tales of the land.  The islands were inhabited until 1954 by a completely Irish-speaking population and today are part of the Gaeltacht. At its peak, the islands had 175 residents. The population declined to 22 by 1953. The government evacuated most of the remaining residents to the mainland on 17 November 1953 because of increasingly extreme winter weather that left the island's ageing population cut off from emergency services. The evacuation was seen as necessary by both the Islanders and the government.

"Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue). Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness. Their taste buds instead respond to acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes. Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 C (100 F) which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the ""prey"" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).",What temperature range do domestic and wild cats prefer their food to be?,92.85714285714286,38 C (100 F),95.71428571428572,Why are cats so picky about what they eat?,"Cats' taste buds respond to acids, protein, and bitter tastes.

"Flesh from these animals is often commercially sold in restaurants as ""langostino"" or sometimes dishonestly called ""lobster"" when incorporated in seafood dishes. As well as being used for human consumption, there is demand for squat lobster meat to be used as feed in fish farms and shrimp or prawn farms. This is in part because they contain astaxanthin, a pigment that helps to colour the meat of farmed salmon and trout. Despite their worldwide distribution and great abundance, there are few functioning fisheries for squat lobsters. Experimental fisheries have occurred in several countries, including Argentina, Mexico, and New Zealand, but commercial exploitation is currently restricted to Latin America, and chiefly to Chile. The main target species are Pleuroncodes monodon, P. planipes, and Cervimunida johni. In Central America, the primary species of squat lobster targeted by fisheries is a species of Pleuroncodes. There is a great deal of confusion over both scientific names and common names, and the exact species is often unknown. In El Salvador, for instance, the commercial catch is generally referred to as ""P. planipes"", but is in fact P. monodon. Commercial fishing for squat lobsters in El Salvador began in the early 1980s; production increased markedly in the 2001 season, and has continued to grow, now making up 98% of the demersal resources landed in El Salvador, with annual catches peaking at 13,708 t in 2005. In Costa Rica, aggregations of squat lobsters are avoided, as the fishermen fear the squat lobsters will clog their nets. In Nicaragua, squat lobsters are heavily exploited, especially following a large increase in fishing effort in the 2007 season. In Panama, production reached 492 t in 2008. Chilean squat lobster fisheries initially targeted Cervimunida johni, beginning in 1953. By the mid-1960s, effort had largely switched to P. monodon. In an effort to conserve stocks, the Chilean government instituted quotas for squat lobsters, and the fishery is closely monitored. In New Zealand, Munida gregaria has been considered as a potential fisheries resource, particularly to feed farmed Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha).","Which two main species of squat lobsters are the primary targets for commercial fishing in Latin America, and which country had the highest recorded annual catch of these species between 2001 and 2008?",94.28571428571428,"Pleuroncodes monodon and P. planipes are the primary targets for commercial fishing in Latin America, with Chile being the country that had the highest recorded annual catch of these species between 2001 and 2008, peaking at 13,708 t in 2005.",94.28571428571428,"Based on the following paragraph on squat lobster fisheries, where do such fisheries exist today?","Commercial fisheries for squat lobsters currently exist only in Latin America, mainly in Chile due to the restriction on commercial exploitation of these animals.

"Several methods exist for storing hydrogen. These include mechanical approaches such as using high pressures and low temperatures, or employing chemical compounds that release H2 upon demand. While large amounts of hydrogen are produced by various industries, it is mostly consumed at the site of production, notably for the synthesis of ammonia. For many years hydrogen has been stored as compressed gas or cryogenic liquid, and transported as such in cylinders, tubes, and cryogenic tanks for use in industry or as propellant in space programs. Interest in using hydrogen for on-board storage of energy in zero-emissions vehicles is motivating the development of new methods of storage, more adapted to this new application. The overarching challenge is the very low boiling point of H2: it boils around 20.268 K (252.882 C or 423.188 F).

"Hifz-ur Rahman (Ottoman Turkish: Merciful Protector) was the second of two Lft- Celil-class ironclads built for the Ottoman Navy in the late 1860s. Originally ordered by the Khedivate of Egypt, an autonomous vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, the central Ottoman government forced Egypt to surrender Hifz-ur Rahman while she was still under construction at the French Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde shipyard. The vessel was a turret ship, armed with two 229 mm (9 in) Armstrong guns and two 178 mm (7 in) Armstrong guns, both pairs in revolving gun turrets.  Hifz-ur Rahman saw action during the Russo-Turkish War in 18771878, where she operated on the Danube to try to prevent Russian forces from crossing the river. While defending the port of Sulina, she engaged Russian gunboats in an inconclusive action. She was laid up for twenty years, until the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, which highlighted the badly deteriorated state of the Ottoman fleet. A large-scale reconstruction program was put in place, and Hifz-ur Rahman was rebuilt in the Imperial Arsenal in the early 1890s. Nevertheless, she saw no further service of any significance, and she was sold for scrap in 1909.","Instruction:

"The First Law of thermodynamics is a formulation of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic processes. A simple formulation is: ""The total energy in a system remains constant, although it may be converted from one form to another."" Another common phrasing is that ""energy can neither be created nor destroyed"" (in a ""closed system""). While there are many subtleties and implications that may be more precisely captured in more complex formulations, this is the essential principle of the First Law.  It distinguishes in principle two forms of energy transfer: heat, and thermodynamic work, for a system of a constant amount of matter.

"Tiramisu appears to have been invented in the 1960s, but where and when exactly is unclear.  The recipe for tiramisu is not found in cookbooks before the 1960s. It is mentioned in a Sydney Morning Herald restaurant column published in 1978. It is not mentioned in encyclopedias and dictionaries of the 1970s, first appearing in an Italian dictionary in 1980, and in English in 1982. It is mentioned in a 1983 cookbook devoted to cooking of the Veneto.  Obituaries for the restaurateur Ado Campeol (19282021) reported that it was invented at his restaurant Le Beccherie in Treviso on 24 December 1969 by his wife Alba di Pillo (19292021) and the pastry chef Roberto Linguanotto. The dish was added to its menu in 1972. Accounts by Carminantonio Iannaccone claim the tiramisu sold at Le Beccherie was made by him in his bakery, created on 24 December 1969.  It has been claimed that tiramisu has aphrodisiac effects and was concocted by a 19th-century Treviso brothel madam, as the Accademia Del Tiramis explains, to ""solve the problems they may have had with their conjugal duties on their return to their wives"".  There is evidence of a ""Tiremes"" semi-frozen dessert served by the Vetturino restaurant in Pieris, in the Friuli Venezia Giulia, since 1938. This may be the name's origin, while the recipe for Tiramisu may have originated as a variation of another layered dessert, Zuppa Inglese. Others claim it was created towards the end of the 17th century in Siena in honour of Grand Duke Cosimo III.  On 29 July 2017, Tiramisu was entered by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies on the list of traditional Friulian and Giulian agri-food products in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region.

"Barbecue or barbeque (informally BBQ in the UK, US, and Canada; barbie in Australia; and braai in South Africa) is a term used with significant regional and national variations to describe various cooking methods that use live fire and smoke to cook the food. The term is also generally applied to the devices associated with those methods, the broader cuisines that these methods produce, and the meals or gatherings at which this style of food is cooked and served. The cooking methods associated with barbecuing vary significantly but most involve outdoor cooking.  The various regional variations of barbecue can be broadly categorized into those methods which use direct and those which use indirect heating. Indirect barbecues are associated with North American cuisine, in which meat is heated by roasting or smoking over wood or charcoal. These methods of barbecue involve cooking using smoke at low temperatures and long cooking times, for several hours. Elsewhere, barbecuing more commonly refers to the more direct application of heat, grilling of food over hot coals or a gas fire. This technique is usually done over direct, dry heat or a hot fire for a few minutes. Within these broader categorizations are further national and regional differences.[","How long and at what temperature does North American-style indirect barbecue involve cooking meat using smoke, compared to the direct application of heat and shorter cooking times typical of other barbecue methods?",92.14285714285714,"North American-style indirect barbecue involves cooking meat using smoke at low temperatures for several hours, typically between 100°F to 250°F (38°C to 121°C).",94.28571428571428,What is barbecue?,Barbecue is a term to describe different cooking methods that use live fire and smoke to cook and the types of devices used.

"The centaurs were usually said to have been born of Ixion and Nephele. As the story goes, Nephele was a cloud made into the likeness of Hera in a plot to trick Ixion into revealing his lust for Hera to Zeus. Ixion seduced Nephele and from that relationship centaurs were created. Another version, however, makes them children of Centaurus, a man who mated with the Magnesian mares. Centaurus was either himself the son of Ixion and Nephele (inserting an additional generation) or of Apollo and the nymph Stilbe. In the latter version of the story, Centaurus's twin brother was Lapithes, ancestor of the Lapiths.  Another tribe of centaurs was said to have lived on Cyprus. According to Nonnus, they were fathered by Zeus, who, in frustration after Aphrodite had eluded him, spilled his seed on the ground of that land.   There were also the Lamian Pheres, twelve rustic daimones (spirits) of the Lamos river. They were set by Zeus to guard the infant Dionysos, protecting him from the machinations of Hera, but the enraged goddess transformed them into ox-horned Centaurs. The Lamian Pheres later accompanied Dionysos in his campaign against the Indians.  The centaur's half-human, half-horse composition has led many writers to treat them as liminal beings, caught between the two natures they embody in contrasting myths; they are both the embodiment of untamed nature, as in their battle with the Lapiths (their kin), and conversely, teachers like Chiron.","What are the two versions of the centaurs' origins mentioned in the context, and how do they differ?",92.14285714285714,"The two versions of the centaurs' origins mentioned in the context are: first, Ixion and Nephele, where Ixion seduced Nephele, a cloud made to resemble Hera, and second, Centaurus, a man who mated with Magnesian mares.

"In mathematics, a metric space is a set together with a notion of distance between its elements, usually called points. The distance is measured by a function called a metric or distance function. Metric spaces are the most general setting for studying many of the concepts of mathematical analysis and geometry.  The most familiar example of a metric space is 3-dimensional Euclidean space with its usual notion of distance. Other well-known examples are a sphere equipped with the angular distance and the hyperbolic plane. A metric may correspond to a metaphorical, rather than physical, notion of distance: for example, the set of 100-character Unicode strings can be equipped with the Hamming distance, which measures the number of characters that need to be changed to get from one string to another.  Since they are very general, metric spaces are a tool used in many different branches of mathematics. Many types of mathematical objects have a natural notion of distance and therefore admit the structure of a metric space, including Riemannian manifolds, normed vector spaces, and graphs. In abstract algebra, the p-adic numbers arise as elements of the completion of a metric structure on the rational numbers. Metric spaces are also studied in their own right in metric geometry and analysis on metric spaces.  Many of the basic notions of mathematical analysis, including balls, completeness, as well as uniform, Lipschitz, and Hlder continuity, can be defined in the setting of metric spaces. Other notions, such as continuity, compactness, and open and closed sets, can be defined for metric spaces, but also in the even more general setting of topological spaces.","Instructions: Identify an example of a metric space where the distance is a metaphorical concept, not related to physical space.

"William Alfred Bayly (15 July 1906  20 July 1934) was a New Zealand farmer and convicted murderer. He was born in Auckland, New Zealand, on 15 July 1906.  In October 1928, Bayly's cousin, 17-year-old Elsie Walker found dead in some scrub in a scoria pit in Panmure, Auckland, with a bruise on her head. Bayly was suspected of killing her, but he was never charged.  Bill Bayly and his wife Phyllis had been dairy farming at Ruawaro, near Huntly, since November 1928. Their neighbours were Samuel and Christobel Lakey. Relations between Bill Bayly and the Lakeys were initially friendly, but soured when Mrs Lakey was said to have accused Bayly of having murdered his niece.  On 16 October 1933 neighbours were concerned as to why the Lakey's cows hadn't been milked that morning. Christobel was discovered lying face down in her pond next to the farmhouse. She had been struck a blow to the face then held down underwater until she drowned. Her husband was missing. Some speculated that her husband had killed her and fled, but it soon became evident that both Lakeys had been the victims of foul play. Two days later bloodstains were found on a wheeled frame near the boundary between the Lakey and Bayly farms, bloodstains were discovered on Bill's sledge, Lakey's guns were found buried in Bayly's swamp, and chemical tests revealed charred bone fragments on a shovel taken from his dairy.  In December Bayly, who had been under surveillance by the police, disappeared, leaving a suicide note. He soon surfaced in Auckland, and was arrested for the murder of Christobel Lakey. More evidence was found in Bayly's garden. Bayly had attempted to incinerate all traces of Lakey. On 10 January 1934 Bayly, was charged with Samuel Lakey's murder.  Bayly was hanged in Mount Eden Prison, Auckland, on 20 July 1934. He was survived by his wife and two young sons.  Police finally buried the remains of Samuel Lakey alongside those of Christobel in Huntly cemetery in 2015.

An autopsy revealed that she had been struck a fatal blow to the face and then held underwater until she drowned. Her husband was still missing.

Suspicion soon fell on William Bayly, the neighbouring farmer, due to his strained relationship with the Lakeys and the discovery of incriminating evidence.

The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity.  Two gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. Both managers have been honoured with statues outside the stadium: Shankly's unveiled in 1997 by the Kop Stand and Paisley's in 2020 by the Main Stand.

Giovanni Dominici (c. 1355  10 June 1419) was an Italian Catholic prelate and Dominican who became a cardinal. His ideas had a profound influence on the art of Fra Angelico who entered the order through him. But he once encountered difficulties becoming a friar due to a speech impairment that his superiors believed would rule him ineligible for both profession and the priesthood. Dominici became a noted theologian and preacher and was tireless in establishing monasteries and convents in cities such as Fiesole and Lucca.  He attempted to resign his cardinalate in 1415 during the Council of Constance after he succeeded in convincing the pope to abdicate in order to end the Western Schism. But the Council refused to accept his resignation though he had resigned from the archbishopric that he held.

"In economics, the Gini coefficient, also known as the Gini index or Gini ratio, is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income inequality or the wealth inequality or the consumption inequality within a nation or a social group. It was developed by statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini. The Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution, such as levels of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same, while a Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) reflects maximal inequality among values. For example, if everyone has the same income, the Gini coefficient will be 0. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 1 indicates that within a group of people, a single individual has all the income or consumption, while all others have none. The Gini coefficient was proposed by Corrado Gini as a measure of inequality of income or wealth.  For OECD countries, in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49, with Slovenia being the lowest and Mexico the highest. African countries had the highest pre-tax Gini coefficients in 20082009, with South Africa having the world's highest, estimated to be 0.63 to 0.7, although this figure drops to 0.52 after social assistance is taken into account, and drops again to 0.47 after taxation. The global income Gini coefficient in 2005 has been estimated to be between 0.61 and 0.68 by various sources.","What is the Gini coefficient value that represents perfect equality in a nation or social group, and provide an example of a situation where this value would occur?",94.28571428571428,"A Gini coefficient of 0 reflects perfect equality, where all income or wealth values are the same.

"The game involves using figures mounted on rotating bars to kick a ball into the opposing goal. Table football tables can vary in size, but a typical table is about 120 centimetres (3.9 ft) long and 61 centimetres (2.00 ft) wide. The table usually contains eight rows of foos men, which are plastic, metal, wooden, or sometimes carbon-fibre figures mounted on horizontal metal bars. Each team of one or two human players controls four rows of foos men, one row each for the goalkeeper, defenders, midfield and strikers. Players manipulate the rods to control the figures, using them to hold up, pass or 'kick' the ball. Games begin when the ball is served through a hole at the side of the table, or simply placed by hand at the feet of a figure in the centre of the table. A coin toss is usually used to determine which player or team serves first. If it is not the first match or if the ball gets out of play or if the ball suddenly stops out, then the team scored last would get the serve after he scores one. The term for when the ball leaves the table or gets stopped somewhere out of the men-like figures reach is dead ball. Expert players have been known to move balls at speeds up to 56 km/h (35 mph) in competition.  The rules prohibit ""over 360-degree shots"", or ""spinning"": using the palm of the hand to swiftly spin the bar all around, instead of using wrist strokes to kick the ball with a bar-mounted figure. Since the establishment of the International Table Soccer Federation (ITSF), the rules have become standardised in most international competitions. However, since January 2012, the annual World Championships and the World Cup have permitted two full 360-degree rotations.  The winner is determined when one team scores a predetermined number of goals, typically five, ten or eleven in competition. When playing Bonzini competitions, the target number of goals is seven and players must win by at least two clear goals.","Generate a clear and specific question that can be fully answered using only the provided context:

Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards; the five community cards and their two hole cards. Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal. The player who has the best hand and has not folded by the end of all betting rounds wins all of the money bet for the hand, known as the pot. In certain situations, a ""split-pot"" or ""tie"" can occur when two players have hands of equivalent value. This is also called a ""chop-pot"".

"The interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement. The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts. However, they can also be awarded for specific recent events. For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Similarly Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords. A recent controversy was caused by awarding the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize to Barack Obama during his first year as US president.","What is an example of a Nobel Peace Prize awarded for a specific recent event, mentioned in the context, and how many years had passed since the event occurred when the prize was awarded?",92.85714285714286,Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations.,94.28571428571428,Please list the Peace Nobel Prize award winners according to the text,"Martti Ahtisaari, Kofi Annan, Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, Barack Obama"

"The Tampa Bay Rays are an American professional baseball team based in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Rays compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. Since its inception, the team's home venue has been Tropicana Field.  Following nearly three decades of unsuccessfully trying to gain an expansion franchise or enticing existing teams to relocate to the Tampa Bay area, an ownership group led by Vince Naimoli was approved on March 9, 1995. The team began play as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 1998 Major League Baseball season.  The team's first decade of play was marked by futility; they finished in last place in the AL East in all but the 2004 season, when they finished second to last. Following the 2007 season, Stuart Sternberg, who had purchased controlling interest in the team from Vince Naimoli two years earlier, changed the team's name from ""Devil Rays"" to ""Rays"", now meaning both a manta ray and a ray of sunshine; a manta ray logo appears on the uniform sleeves while a sunburst appears on the uniform front. The 2008 season saw the Rays post their first winning season, their first AL East championship, and their first American League pennant (defeating the rival Boston Red Sox in the ALCS), though they lost to the Philadelphia Phillies in that year's World Series. Since then, the Rays have played in the postseason seven more times, winning the American League pennant again in 2020 and losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers in that year's World Series.  The Tampa Bay Rays' chief rivals are the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees, which also play in the AL East. Regarding the former, there have been several notable on-field incidents. The Rays also have an in-state interleague rivalry with the National League (NL)'s Miami Marlins (originally the Florida Marlins), whom they play in the Citrus Series.

"Thanjavur painting is a classical South Indian painting style, which was inaugurated from the town of Thanjavur (anglicized as Tanjore) in Tamil Nadu. The art form draws its immediate resources and inspiration from way back about 1600 AD, a period when the Nayakas of Thanjavur under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara Rayas encouraged artchiefly, classical dance and musicas well as literature, both in Telugu and Tamil and painting of chiefly Hindu religious subjects in temples. It is distinguished by its famous gold coating. However, it can safely be surmised that Thanjavur painting, as we know it now, originated in the Maratha court of Thanjavur (16761855).It has been recognized as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 200708. Thanjavur paintings are characterized by rich and vivid colors, simple icon composition, glittering gold foils overlaid on delicate but extensive gesso work and inlay of glass beads and pieces or precious and semi-precious gems. In Thanjavur paintings one can see the influence of Deccani, Vijayanagar, Maratha and even European or Company styles of painting. Essentially serving as devotional icons, the subjects of most paintings are Hindu gods, goddesses, and saints. Episodes from Hindu Puranas, Sthala-puranas and other religious texts were visualized, sketched or traced and painted with the main figure or figures placed in the central section of the picture (mostly within an architecturally delineated space such as a mantapa or prabhavali) surrounded by several subsidiary figures, themes and subjects. There are also many instances when Jain, Sikh, Muslim, other religious and even secular subjects were depicted in Tanjore paintings. Thanjavur paintings are panel paintings done on wooden planks, and hence referred to as Palagai padam in local parlance. In modern times, these paintings have become souvenirs for festive occasions in South India.","What are the primary sources of inspiration and resources for Thanjavur painting, and how did they influence the art form's development?",92.14285714285714,"Thanjavur painting draws its immediate resources and inspiration from the Nayakas of Thanjavur under the suzerainty of the Vijayanagara Rayas, dating back to around 1600 AD.

When matter falls onto a black hole, it can form an external accretion disk, which can heat up due to friction and emit intense electromagnetic radiation, resulting in the formation of quasars - extremely bright and energetic objects. This phenomenon helps distinguish black holes from other celestial objects, such as neutron stars, which do not produce such intense radiation.

The observation of these streamers, or X-ray emissions, can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location by studying the stars' orbits and the amount of radiation emitted.

The orbits of stars around a black hole differ significantly from those around other celestial objects due to the extreme gravitational forces exerted by the black hole. These differences can be used to exclude possible alternatives, such as neutron stars, which do not exhibit the same orbital characteristics.

"N.V. Virgin Express S.A. was a Belgian airline created within the Virgin Group. It operated flights mainly to southern Europe from its hub at Brussels Airport. Ticket sales were mainly through the Internet. The airline merged with SN Brussels Airlines to form Brussels Airlines, which started operations on 25 March 2007. Virgin Express' head office was in Building 116 at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, Belgium, near Brussels.  History Virgin Express was founded on 23 April 1996, when the Virgin Group (with chairman Richard Branson) bought the Belgian leisure airline EBA - EuroBelgian Airlines, founded by Victor Hasson and Georges Gutelman, and rebranded it Virgin Express. It also took over EBA's fleet of Boeing 737s and operated this type of aircraft from thereon. The airline soon concentrated on low-budget scheduled flights out of its Brussels hub, and became a major competitor for Sabena and later SN Brussels Airlines.  In October 2004, the Virgin Group sold its assets to SN Brussels Airlines, and both airlines were integrated into the parent holding company SN Airholding, chaired by Viscount tienne Davignon.  On 31 March 2006, SN Brussels Airlines and Virgin Express announced their merger into a single company, named Brussels Airlines.

"Dried fruit is fruit from which the majority of the original water content has been removed either naturally, through sun drying, or through the use of specialized dryers or dehydrators. Dried fruit has a long tradition of use dating back to the fourth millennium BC in Mesopotamia, and is prized because of its sweet taste, nutritive value and long shelf life. Today, dried fruit consumption is widespread. Nearly half of the dried fruits sold are raisins, followed by dates, prunes, figs, apricots, peaches, apples, and pears. These are referred to as ""conventional"" or ""traditional"" dried fruits: fruits that have been dried in the sun or in heated wind tunnel dryers. Many fruits such as cranberries, blueberries, cherries, strawberries, and mango are infused with a sweetener (e.g. sucrose syrup) prior to drying.

"The appearance of a pickleball court, and the manner of play, resembles tennis, but the court is the size of a doubles badminton court, less than a third the size of a tennis court. Court lines and rules are specific to pickleball and include two 7-foot areas (2.1 m) on either side of the net known as the non-volley zones, where the ball cannot be hit with the paddle unless the ball bounces first. The official rules specify side-out scoring, where only the serving team can score a point. All serves are made with an underhand stroke. The hard plastic ball used in pickleball produces significantly less bounce than softer flexible balls, such as a tennis ball. The minimal bounce combined with the non-volley zone and underhand serve give the game dynamic pace and strategy ranging from soft dink shots that stay within the two non-volley zones to powerful drive shots and overhead smash shots. To minimize any advantage the serving or receiving side might have at the beginning of the game, the ball must bounce once on each side of the net before either team may volley the ball, which is to hit the ball in the air before it bounces.","What are the two specific areas on a pickleball court where the ball cannot be hit with the paddle unless the ball bounces first, and what is the approximate length of each area in meters?",94.28571428571428,"The two specific areas on a pickleball court where the ball cannot be hit with the paddle unless the ball bounces first are the non-volley zones, which are located on either side of the net.

"A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.  RBMs were initially invented under the name Harmonium by Paul Smolensky in 1986, and rose to prominence after Geoffrey Hinton and collaborators invented fast learning algorithms for them in the mid-2000. RBMs have found applications in dimensionality reduction, classification, collaborative filtering, feature learning, topic modelling and even many body quantum mechanics. They can be trained in either supervised or unsupervised ways, depending on the task.  As their name implies, RBMs are a variant of Boltzmann machines, with the restriction that their neurons must form a bipartite graph: a pair of nodes from each of the two groups of units (commonly referred to as the ""visible"" and ""hidden"" units respectively) may have a symmetric connection between them; and there are no connections between nodes within a group. By contrast, ""unrestricted"" Boltzmann machines may have connections between hidden units. This restriction allows for more efficient training algorithms than are available for the general class of Boltzmann machines, in particular the gradient-based contrastive divergence algorithm.  Restricted Boltzmann machines can also be used in deep learning networks. In particular, deep belief networks can be formed by ""stacking"" RBMs and optionally fine-tuning the resulting deep network with gradient descent and backpropagation.","What are the two groups of units in a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and what type of connections are permitted between nodes from these groups?",92.14285714285714,"The two groups of units in a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) are the ""visible"" and ""hidden"" units.

"The United States Electoral College is the group of presidential electors required by the Constitution to form every four years for the sole purpose of appointing the president and vice president. Each state and the District of Columbia appoints electors pursuant to the methods described by its legislature, equal in number to its congressional delegation (representatives and senators). Federal office holders, including senators and representatives, cannot be electors. Of the current 538 electors, an absolute majority of 270 or more electoral votes is required to elect the president and vice president. If no candidate achieves an absolute majority there, a contingent election is held by the House of Representatives to elect the president and by the Senate to elect the vice president. The states and the District of Columbia hold a statewide or districtwide popular vote on Election Day in November to choose electors based upon how they have pledged to vote for president and vice president, with some state laws proscribing faithless electors. All states except Maine and Nebraska use a party block voting, or general ticket method, to choose their electors, meaning all their electors go to one winning ticket.

"Racial categories have historically been used as a way to enable an oppressive figure or group to discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor. In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eugne Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals.","What specific details in Eugène Delacroix's painting ""Women of Algiers in their Apartment"" contribute to the portrayal of racial and cultural stereotypes?",82.14285714285714,"The specific details in Eugène Delacroix's painting ""Women of Algiers in their Apartment"" that contribute to the portrayal of racial and cultural stereotypes include the contrast between the three women in exotic clothing and the African woman dressed in plain attire, implying a power dynamic and reinforcing the stereotype of African women as subservient.

"Dynasties in Chinese history, or Chinese dynasties, were hereditary monarchical regimes that ruled over China during much of its history. From the legendary inauguration of dynastic rule by Yu the Great circa 2070 BC to the abdication of the Xuantong Emperor on 12 February 1912 in the wake of the Xinhai Revolution, China was ruled by a series of successive dynasties. Dynasties of China were not limited to those established by ethnic Hanthe dominant Chinese ethnic groupand its predecessor, the Huaxia tribal confederation, but also included those founded by non-Han peoples.  Dividing Chinese history into periods ruled by dynasties is a convenient method of periodization. Accordingly, a dynasty may be used to delimit the era during which a family reigned, as well as to describe events, trends, personalities, artistic compositions, and artifacts of that period. For example, porcelain made during the Ming dynasty may be referred to as ""Ming porcelain"". The word ""dynasty"" is usually omitted when making such adjectival references.  The longest-reigning orthodox dynasty of China was the Zhou dynasty, ruling for a total length of 789 years, albeit it is divided into the Western Zhou and the Eastern Zhou in Chinese historiography, and its power was drastically reduced during the latter part of its rule.

"An oil field is an area of accumulation of liquid oil underground in multiple (potentially linked) reservoirs, trapped as it rises by impermeable rock formations. In industrial terms, an oil field implies that there is economic benefit worthy of commercial attention. Oil fields themselves may extend up to several hundred kilometers across the surface, meaning that extraction efforts can be large and spread out across the area. In addition to extraction equipment, there may be exploratory wells probing the edges to find more reservoir area, pipelines to transport the oil elsewhere, and support facilities.  Oil fields can occur anywhere that the geology of the underlying rock allows, meaning that certain fields can be far away from civilization, including at sea. Creating an operation at an oil field can be a logistically complex undertaking, as it involves not only the equipment associated with extraction and transportation, but infrastructure such as roads and housing for workers. This infrastructure has to be designed with the lifespan of the oil field in mind, as production can last many years. Several companies, such as Hill International, Bechtel, Esso, Weatherford International, Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes and Halliburton, have organizations that specialize in the large-scale construction of the infrastructure to support oil field exploitation.","Question: Which infrastructure components, specifically, are engineered to last the duration of an oil field's production, and why is this important?",92.14285714285714,"Roads, housing for workers, and other infrastructure components such as pipelines, storage facilities, and processing equipment are engineered to last the duration of an oil field's production.

"A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.","Based on the context, calculate the temperature in billionths of a kelvin that a stellar black hole is predicted to emit as Hawking radiation according to quantum field theory in curved spacetime.",94.28571428571428,The temperature of a stellar black hole emitting Hawking radiation according to quantum field theory in curved spacetime is inversely proportional to its mass and is of the order of billionths of a kelvin.,94.28571428571428,Is black hole truly black?,"According to general relativity, a black hole emits no lights at all.

In this sense, a black hole is not truly black."
"George Watson Buck (17891854) was the engineer of the Montgomeryshire Canal in the early 19th century, and was responsible for the unique lock paddle design.  He was later resident engineer during the building of the London and Birmingham Railway, and also designed Stockport Viaduct and the Dane Valley Viaduct on the Manchester and Birmingham Railway.  Early life Buck was born on 1 April 1789 at Stoke Holy Cross, near Norwich. His parents were Quakers and sent him, with his two brothers, to the Quaker School at Ackworth, West Yorkshire. With his schooling completed, his father placed him with a wholesaler at Tower Hill, London, as he wanted him to be involved in trade, but the position did not suit Buck, and so he looked for something else. Around 1807, the East London Waterworks Company were building Old Ford pumping station, which had been designed by Ralph Walker, and Buck managed to secure a job there. When the job was finished, Walker moved on to Farlington, to work on a water supply scheme for Portsmouth and Gosport. The scheme had been authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1809, and Buck went to work as resident engineer, reporting to Walker. The scheme suffered from an intermittent water supply, as did a competing scheme engineered by William Nicholson.","Which water supply scheme, designed by Ralph Walker and authorized by an Act of Parliament in 1809, did George Watson Buck work on as a resident engineer after leaving Old Ford pumping station?",94.28571428571428,"George Watson Buck worked on the water supply scheme for Portsmouth and Gosport, designed by Ralph Walker and authorized by an Act of Parliament in 1809, as a resident engineer after leaving Old Ford pumping station.",95.71428571428572,"Given a reference text about George Watson Buck, tell me where he went to Quaker School and where he got a job in 1807.","George Watson Buck went to Quaker School at Ackworth, West Yorkshire and got a job at the East London Waterworks Company in 1807."

"Ergometer rowing machines (colloquially ergs or ergo) simulate the rowing action and provide a means of training on land when waterborne training is restricted, and of measuring rowing fitness. Ergometers do not simulate the lateral balance challenges, the exact resistance of water, or the exact motions of true rowing including the sweep of the oar handles. For that reason ergometer scores are generally not used as the sole selection criterion for crews (colloquially ""ergs don't float""), and technique training is limited to the basic body position and movements. However, this action can still allow a workout comparable to those experienced on the water. Indoor rowing has become popular as a sport in its own right with numerous indoor competitions (and the annual World Championship CRASH-B Sprints in Boston) during the winter off-season.","What features of true rowing are not replicated by ergometer rowing machines, and how do these differences impact the training and evaluation of rowers?",94.28571428571428,"Ergometer rowing machines do not replicate the lateral balance challenges, the exact resistance of water, or the exact motions of true rowing, including the sweep of the oar handles.

"Isma'il ibn Ahmad ibn Hassan bani Yani (Arabic:       ), known simply as Isma'il Ragheb Pasha (Arabic:   ) (18191884), was a Greek Ottoman politician who served as a Prime Minister of Egypt and held several other high-ranking government positions.  Isma'il Ragheb was of Greek ancestry and was born in Greece on 18 August 1819 on either the island of Chios following the great massacre of Candia, Crete. After being kidnapped to Anatolia he was brought to Egypt as a slave by Ibrahim Pasha in 1830 and was converted to Islam. Immediately following his arrival, he studied at al-Maktab al-Amiri and obtained his advanced degree in 1834. He was fluent in Greek and was elevated to the rank of First Lieutenant by Egypt's viceroy Muhammad Ali Pasha. In 1836, he became head of the Accounting and Revenue Agencies. He was promoted to the rank of bikbashi (Lieutenant Colonel) in 1840, then kaymakam (Colonel) in 1844, and finally amiralay (Brigadier General) in 1846.[citation needed]  He held the positions of Minister of Finance (18581860), then Minister of War (18601861).[citation needed] He became Inspector for the Maritime Provinces in 1862, and later Assistant (Arabic: ) to viceroy Isma'il Pasha (18631865).

"The Bobcaygeon Independent was the weekly community newspaper in Bobcaygeon, Ontario, Canada. It was established in 1869. Ownership changed hands many times over the years, until it was purchased along with then owner, Citizens Communication Group, in 2000 by Metroland Publishing.  The Independent covered everything from community events, school issues & family milestones to local crimes and tragedies. During ownership by the Citizens Communication Group, the Bobcaygeon and Fenelon news teams worked closely together, and from time to time, some stories of general interest would run simultaneously in the Independent and its sister paper the Fenelon Falls Gazette.

"A variety of recipes have been described for obtaining this blue-green patina on copper, brass, or bronze. It was originally made by hanging copper plates over hot vinegar in a sealed pot until a green crust formed on the copper. Another method, used in the Middle Ages, was to attach copper strips to a wooden block with acetic acid, then bury the sealed block in dung. A few weeks later, the block was to be dug up, and the verdigris scraped off. In eighteenth-century Montpellier, France, it was manufactured in household cellars, ""where copper plates were stacked in clay pots filled with distilled wine.""

"A chemical structure determination includes a chemist's specifying the molecular geometry and, when feasible and necessary, the electronic structure of the target molecule or other solid. Molecular geometry refers to the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule and the chemical bonds that hold the atoms together and can be represented using structural formulae and by molecular models; complete electronic structure descriptions include specifying the occupation of a molecule's molecular orbitals. Structure determination can be applied to a range of targets from very simple molecules (e.g., diatomic oxygen or nitrogen) to very complex ones (e.g., such as protein or DNA).","Instruction: Based on the context, identify and describe the two distinct types of structure descriptions a chemist can provide for a target molecule, using specific examples for each.",94.28571428571428,"According to the context, a chemist can offer two primary types of structure descriptions for a target molecule: molecular geometry and electronic structure. Firstly, molecular geometry refers to the arrangement of atoms within a molecule and the chemical bonds that keep them together. For instance, the molecular geometry of diatomic oxygen (O2) can be described as a linear structure, where two oxygen atoms are bonded together with a bond length of approximately 1.21 Å and an angle between them of 180 degrees. This type of description is crucial for understanding chemical reactions and properties, as it provides insight into the spatial arrangement of atoms and the chemical bonds that hold them together. For example, in the case of diatomic oxygen, its linear molecular geometry allows it to easily react with other molecules, such as hydrogen, to form water.

Secondly, electronic structure involves specifying the distribution of electrons within a molecule's orbitals. As an example, let's consider the electronic structure of methane (CH4). This molecule has a tetrahedral geometry, with carbon at the center and four hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Its electronic structure can be described as having one s-orbital and three p-orbitals filled with electrons for the carbon atom, and one s-orbital filled for each hydrogen atom. The first two energy levels, s and p, are completely filled with electrons for methane, resulting in a stable electronic configuration. This type of description is essential for understanding a molecule's reactivity and potential interactions with other molecules, as it provides insight into the distribution of electrons within the molecule's orbitals. For instance, the electronic structure of methane allows it to react with other molecules, such as oxygen, to form compounds like methanol.",92.14285714285714,What is a chemical structure?,"A chemical structure determination includes a chemist's specifying the molecular geometry and, when feasible and necessary, the electronic structure of the target molecule or other solid."

"Life arose from the Earth's first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago. Since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution. Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life. In terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O). Because the OH bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge. This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive. Surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid. Water is also adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules. Water is denser as a liquid than it is as a solid (or ice). This unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby insulating the liquid below from the cold air above. Water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher specific heat capacity than other solvents such as ethanol. Thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor. As a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again. In pure water, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a pH that is neutral.","What are the properties of water that make it an effective solvent, and how do these properties contribute to its role in sustaining life?",94.28571428571428,"Water's effective solvent properties are primarily due to its polar molecular structure, which enables it to dissolve solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution.

[Question 1]: What type of railways does the British Office of Rail and Road consider as 'heritage railways'?
[Question 2]: In what ways do these railways replicate the character and appearance of historic former railway companies?
[Question 3]: What operating practices do heritage railways adopt from their historic counterparts?
[Question 4]: How do these railways contribute to the community and provide transport facilities?
[Question 5]: Which elements of heritage railways are considered of historic value?",92.14285714285714,"
Heritage railways, as defined by the British Office of Rail and Road, are ""lines of local interest"", museum railways, or tourist railways that have preserved the character, appearance, and operating practices of railways from earlier periods. These railways often operate on former railway lines and aim to replicate the look and practices of historic former railway companies. They provide genuine transport facilities in some cases, serving as community links, and function primarily as tourist or educational attractions. Much of the rolling stock and equipment used on these systems is original and holds historic value.",94.28571428571428,When would a railway be considered a heritage railway?,"Generally speaking, a railway can be considered a heritage railway when it assumes the appearance, characteristics, and operations of that railway from a period(s) in its past. These railways are often old and have been intentionally preserved to maintain its operating practices from prior times, purposely keeping equipment and processes original to a period in the past. Many of these heritage railways are preserved for educational purposes or as tourist attractions."
"Another trait unique to domestic sheep as compared to wild ovines is their wide variation in color. Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald. Sheep keepers also sometimes artificially paint ""smit marks"" onto their sheep in any pattern or color for identification. Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly. However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks. While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning. The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike. There is variation of wool type and quality even among members of the same flock, so wool classing is a step in the commercial processing of the fibre.","What specific traits contributed to the wide range of colors in domestic sheep fleece, and how does this variation impact the wool classification process?",92.14285714285714,"The wide range of colors in domestic sheep fleece is attributed to two factors: genetic variation and artificial marking. Domestic sheep have a more extensive genetic variation in color compared to wild ovines, with colors ranging from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald. Additionally, sheep keepers sometimes artificially paint ""smit marks"" onto their sheep for identification, which also contributes to the color variation.

"Yu 12 was an Imperial Japanese Army transport submarine of the Yu 1 subclass of the Yu I type. Constructed for use during the latter stages of World War II, she served in the waters of the Japanese archipelago.  Construction In the final two years of World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army constructed transport submarines  officially the Type 3 submergence transport vehicle and known to the Japanese Army as the Maru Yu  with which to supply its isolated island garrisons in the Pacific. Only submarines of the Yu I type were completed and saw service. The Yu I type was produced in four subclasses, each produced by a different manufacturer and differing primarily in the design of their conning towers and details of their gun armament. None carried torpedoes or had torpedo tubes. Yu 12 was a unit of the Yu 1 subclass.  The Hitachi Kasado Works (Hitachi Kasado Seisakujo) at Kudamatsu, Japan, constructed Yu 12.

"Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet, FRS (14 November 1797  22 February 1875) was a Scottish geologist who demonstrated the power of known natural causes in explaining the earth's history. He is best known as the author of Principles of Geology (183033), which presented to a wide public audience the idea that the earth was shaped by the same natural processes still in operation today, operating at similar intensities. The philosopher William Whewell termed this gradualistic view ""uniformitarianism"" and contrasted it with catastrophism, which had been championed by Georges Cuvier and was better accepted in Europe. The combination of evidence and eloquence in Principles convinced a wide range of readers of the significance of ""deep time"" for understanding the earth and environment.","What are the two contrasting views on the shaping of the earth presented in Sir Charles Lyell's work ""Principles of Geology"", and what terms did philosopher William Whewell use to describe them?",94.28571428571428,"Sir Charles Lyell's work ""Principles of Geology"" presented two contrasting views on the shaping of the earth: uniformitarianism and catastrophism.

"The video game crash of 1983 (known as the Atari shock in Japan) was a large-scale recession in the video game industry that occurred from 1983 to 1985, primarily in the United States. The crash was attributed to several factors, including market saturation in the number of video game consoles and available games, many of which were of poor quality, as well as waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. Home video game revenues peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash abruptly ended what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America. To a lesser extent, the arcade video game market also weakened as the golden age of arcade video games came to an end.  Lasting about two years, the crash shook a then-booming video game industry and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles. Analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of video game consoles and software.  The North American video game console industry recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of Nintendo's Western branding for its Famicom console, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), released in 1985. The NES was designed to avoid the missteps that caused the 1983 crash and the stigma associated with video games at that time.","Based on the context, identify at least two specific reasons for the decline in home video game revenues during the video game crash of 1983-1985, and explain how each factor contributed to the industry's downturn.",92.14285714285714,"The video game crash of 1983-1985 was attributed to two primary factors that contributed to the decline in home video game revenues. Firstly, market saturation led to a glut of video game consoles and available games, causing consumer confusion and reducing demand. This oversupply of options made it difficult for consumers to distinguish between quality and poor-quality games, ultimately leading to a loss of faith in the industry. According to the context, the number of consoles and games released during this period was excessive, with home video game revenues peaking at around $3.2 billion in 1983 before plummeting to around $100 million by 1985. Secondly, the proliferation of poor-quality games further eroded consumer confidence, as many games were released with little attention to quality or playability. This lack of quality control resulted in a perception that video games were not worth investing in, exacerbating the decline in home video game revenues.",92.14285714285714,Describe the video game crash of 1983 in 2 sentences.,Home video game revenues in North America declined from $3.2 billion in 1983 to around $100 million in 1985.

"An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one or more forms of energy into mechanical energy. Available energy sources include potential energy (e.g. energy of the Earth's gravitational field as exploited in hydroelectric power generation), heat energy (e.g. geothermal), chemical energy, electric potential and nuclear energy (from nuclear fission or nuclear fusion). Many of these processes generate heat as an intermediate energy form, so heat engines have special importance.
