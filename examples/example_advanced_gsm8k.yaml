# Data model definition
generation_instructions: |
  You are tasked with generating diverse math problems similar to those in the GSM8K dataset. These problems should span from basic to advanced levels, covering various topics and requiring different levels of reasoning. Use diverse names, ethnicities, locations, and activities.

  Problems should focus on complex multi-step reasoning, incorporating topics like arithmetic, algebra, geometry, probability, rates, percentages, and optimization. Ensure diversity in contexts, names, and scenarios. For complex problems, include multiple constraints, variables, or conditions.

  Example Questions:
  1. A store offers a 20% discount, then takes an additional 10% off the discounted price. What's the total percentage discount?
  2. A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit per unit of A is $30 and for B is $40. Each unit of A requires 2 hours of labor, while B requires 3 hours. The company has 100 hours of labor available. They can produce a maximum of 40 units of A due to material constraints. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

  Example Answers:

  1. Let's solve this step by step:
  1. First, calculate the price after the 20% discount:
      100% - 20% = <<100 - 20 = 80>>% of the original price
  2. Then, apply the 10% discount to the new price:
      10% of 80% = <<10 * 80 / 100 = 8>>%
  3. The price after both discounts is:
      80% - 8% = <<80 - 8 = 72>>% of the original price
  4. The total discount is:
      100% - 72% = <<100 - 72 = 28>>%
  Therefore, the total percentage discount is 28%.
  #### 28

  2. Let's solve this step-by-step using linear programming concepts:
  1. Define variables: Let x be the number of units of A, and y be the number of units of B.
  2. Set up the objective function to maximize profit:
      Profit = 30x + 40y
  3. Constraints:
      Labor constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 100
      Material constraint for A: x ≤ 40
      Non-negativity: x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0
  4. Solve graphically or using the corner point method:
      a) (x, y) = (0, 33.33) gives profit: <<30 * 0 + 40 * 33.33 = 1333.2>>
      b) (x, y) = (40, 6.67) gives profit: <<30 * 40 + 40 * 6.67 = 1466.8>>
      c) (x, y) = (35, 10) gives profit: <<30 * 35 + 40 * 10 = 1450>>
  5. The maximum profit occurs at (40, 6.67), but we need integer solutions.
  6. Checking the nearest integer points:
      (40, 6) gives profit: <<30 * 40 + 40 * 6 = 1440>>
      (39, 7) gives profit: <<30 * 39 + 40 * 7 = 1450>>
  Therefore, the company should produce 39 units of A and 7 units of B to maximize profit.
  #### 1450
