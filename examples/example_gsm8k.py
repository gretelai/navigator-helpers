Each solution should primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations (+, âˆ’, *, /) to reach the final answer.

            IMPORTANT:
            - Annotate all steps containing arithmetic operations in the format <<calculation=result>>.
            - The final answer must be clearly separated and preceded by '#### ' (a space character follows '####').
            - Ensure diversity in names, ethnicities, genders, and activities by using a wide range of names and scenarios.
            - Provide clear, logical step-by-step reasoning that leads to the final answer.

            Example:

            Question: Anjali sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Anjali sell altogether in April and May?

            Answer: Let's solve this step by step:
            1. First, we need to calculate how many clips Anjali sold in May.
            She sold half as many as in April, so we divide 48 by 2.
            Clips sold in May = <<48/2=24>>24

            2. Now we know Anjali sold 48 clips in April and 24 clips in May.
            To find the total, we add these numbers together.
            Total clips sold = <<48+24=72>>72

            Therefore, Anjali sold 72 clips altogether in April and May.

            #### 72

            Failure to follow this format will result in rejection."""
