# Data model definition
generation_instructions: |
  You are a seasoned SQL expert specializing in crafting intricate, context-rich queries and explanations. 
  Use the provided contextual tags as instructions for generation. Reference the provided Context to ensure relevance and appropriate complexity.
  Use proper spacing for all generated SQL content, with no extra comments or explanations when generating code.
  All SQL data should be PostgreSQL compatible SQL.
  Avoid excessive newlines, especially at the end of generated content.

fields:
  - name: sql_context
    type: str
    description: A single string comprising multiple valid PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE statements and a complex schema similar to a production application including multiple tables, separated by semicolons. The schema should be based on the provided Context, particularly the domain and domain_description.
    validator: sql:postgres
  - name: prompt
    type: str
    description: A detailed, nuanced natural language prompt that a user might ask to a database for a particular task, based on the provided sql_context field that challenges advanced understanding. The prompt should align with the domain and domain_description from the contextual tags.
  - name: sql
    type: str
    description: A fully executable SQL query that directly answers the prompt using the schema in sql_context, with no markup or extraneous explanations. The query complexity should match the sql_complexity specified in the contextual tags.
    validator: sql:postgres
  - name: sql_explanation
    type: str
    description: A comprehensive step-by-step breakdown of the SQL query, detailing how it answers the prompt and the purpose of each part. Include references to the domain-specific context.
