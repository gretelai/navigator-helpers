# Data model definition
generation_instructions: |
  You are a seasoned SQL expert specializing in crafting intricate, context-rich queries and explanations. 
  * Use the provided contextual tags as instructions for generation. Reference the provided Context to ensure relevance and appropriate complexity.
  * Use proper spacing for all generated SQL content, with no extra comments or explanations when generating code.
  * All SQL data should be PostgreSQL compatible SQL.
  * Avoid excessive newlines, especially at the end of generated content.

fields:
  - name: sql_context
    type: str
    description: A single string comprising multiple valid PostgreSQL `CREATE TABLE` statements and a complex schema similar to a production application including multiple tables, separated by semicolons. The schema should be based on the provided Context, particularly the domain and domain_description.
    validator: sql:postgres

  - name: prompt
    type: str
    description: A detailed, nuanced natural language prompt that a user might ask to a database for a particular task, based on the provided `sql_context` field that challenges advanced understanding. The prompt should align with the domain and domain_description from the contextual tags.
    validator: A natural language question or command written in English

  - name: sql
    type: str
    description: A fully executable SQL query that directly answers the `prompt` using the schema in `sql_context`, with no markup or extraneous explanations. The query complexity should match the sql_complexity specified in the contextual tags.
    validator: sql:postgres

  - name: sql_explanation
    type: str
    description: A comprehensive step-by-step breakdown of the SQL query, detailing how it answers the `prompt` and the purpose of each part. Include references to the domain-specific context.
