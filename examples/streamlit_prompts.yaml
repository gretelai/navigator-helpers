  ### Example:

  #### Question:
  A city planner is designing a new circular park with a fountain at its center. The park has a radius of 50 meters, and eight equally spaced pathways radiate from the central fountain to the park's edge. The city wants to add a circular walking path that intersects all eight radial pathways at a distance of 30 meters from the fountain. Calculate the total area of grass in the park (excluding the fountain, pathways, and walking path) to the nearest square meter.

  Assume:
  - The central fountain has a radius of 2 meters.
  - All pathways have a width of 1.5 meters.
  - The circular walking path has a width of 2 meters.

  #### Answer:
  Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

  1. First, let's identify the areas we need to calculate:
    - Total area of the park
    - Area of the fountain
    - Area of the radial pathways
    - Area of the circular walking path

  2. Calculate the total area of the park:
    A_total = πr² = π * 50² = 7,853.98 m²

  3. Calculate the area of the fountain:
    A_fountain = πr² = π * 2² = 12.57 m²

  4. Calculate the area of the radial pathways:
    - Each pathway is 1.5m wide and 50m long
    - Area of one pathway = 1.5m * 50m = 75 m²
    - Total area of pathways = 75 m² * 8 = 600 m²

  5. Calculate the area of the circular walking path:
    - Outer radius of the path = 30m + 1m = 31m
    - Inner radius of the path = 30m - 1m = 29m
    - A_path = π(R² - r²) = π(31² - 29²) = 371.95 m²

  6. Calculate the total area of non-grass features:
    A_non_grass = A_fountain + A_pathways + A_path
    A_non_grass = 12.57 + 600 + 371.95 = 984.52 m²

  7. Calculate the grass area:
    A_grass = A_total - A_non_grass
    A_grass = 7,853.98 - 984.52 = 6,869.46 m²

  8. Round to the nearest square meter:
    A_grass ≈ 6,869 m²

  Therefore, the total area of grass in the park, rounded to the nearest square meter, is 6,869 m².

  Task: Create a Collegiate Post-Doctoral Level Mathematical Dataset

  Objective:
  Create a dataset of advanced mathematical problems suitable for post-doctoral level research in mathematics, physics, or related fields. The problems should require sophisticated mathematical reasoning, involve multiple concepts, and necessitate a step-by-step approach to reach a solution. Each problem must have a single, clearly defined numerical answer.

  Dataset Requirements:
  1. Problems should span various advanced mathematical fields such as abstract algebra, topology, advanced calculus, complex analysis, differential geometry, number theory, and mathematical physics.
  2. Each problem should require the application of multiple advanced concepts and techniques.
  3. Solutions should demonstrate rigorous mathematical thinking and detailed step-by-step reasoning.
  4. Problems should have real-world applications or connections to current research topics when possible.
  5. The final answer for each problem must be a single, well-defined number.

  Output Schema:
  Each entry in the dataset should contain the following fields in plain text format:

  1. Question: A detailed description of the problem, including any necessary context or background information.

  2. Answer: A comprehensive, step-by-step solution that includes:
    - Initial approach and problem decomposition
    - Relevant theorems, lemmas, or principles applied
    - Detailed mathematical derivations
    - Intermediate results and their significance
    - Final numerical solution

  Example:

  Question:
  In a certain quantum system, the ground state energy E_0 is given by the smallest positive root of the equation:

  J_0(sqrt(E)) - 2J_1(sqrt(E)) = 0

  where J_0 and J_1 are Bessel functions of the first kind of order 0 and 1, respectively. Using numerical methods, determine the ground state energy E_0 to 6 decimal places.

  Answer:
  Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

  1. We need to find the smallest positive root of the equation:
    J_0(sqrt(E)) - 2J_1(sqrt(E)) = 0

  2. This equation cannot be solved analytically, so we'll use numerical methods. We'll employ a combination of bracketing and refining techniques.

  3. First, let's define our function:
    f(E) = J_0(sqrt(E)) - 2J_1(sqrt(E))

  4. We need to find an interval where f(E) changes sign. Let's evaluate f(E) for some values:
    f(1) ≈ 0.3081 > 0
    f(2) ≈ -0.1801 < 0

    So, the root lies between 1 and 2.

  5. Now, let's use the bisection method to refine our solution:

    Iteration 1: E = 1.5, f(1.5) ≈ 0.0777 > 0
    Iteration 2: E = 1.75, f(1.75) ≈ -0.0461 < 0
    Iteration 3: E = 1.625, f(1.625) ≈ 0.0168 > 0
    Iteration 4: E = 1.6875, f(1.6875) ≈ -0.0144 < 0
    ...

  6. Continuing this process and refining our solution, we eventually converge to:

    E_0 ≈ 1.642854

  7. To verify, we can check:
    f(1.642854) ≈ -1.2e-7, which is very close to zero.

  8. We can further refine this result using more advanced methods like Newton-Raphson, but this result is accurate to 6 decimal places.

  Therefore, the ground state energy E_0 of the quantum system, rounded to 6 decimal places, is 1.642854.

  explanation: '''
  1. Create HospitalMetrics CTE:

    - Calculate total funding amount, average patient satisfaction, and collaborator count for each hospital.
    - Filter data for the last 3 years using report_date and project start_date.

  2. Create RankedHospitals CTE:
    - Use window function RANK() to rank hospitals based on a composite score (total funding * average satisfaction).

  3. Create CollaboratorList CTE:
    - Join Collaborations with Hospitals to get collaborator information.
    - Use GROUP_CONCAT to create a list of collaborators from different locations.

  4. Final SELECT:
    - Combine data from RankedHospitals and CollaboratorList CTEs.
    - Filter to include only the top 5 hospitals.
    - Order results by hospital rank.

  5. The query handles complex relationships:
    - Many-to-many relationships between Hospitals and ResearchProjects.
    - Self-referencing relationship in Collaborations table.

  6. It uses advanced SQL features:
    - Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for better query organization.
    - Window functions for ranking.
    - Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) with GROUP BY.
    - Subqueries in the WHERE clause.
    - GROUP_CONCAT for string aggregation.
  
  Note: This example represents just one type of healthcare analytics query. Your generated queries should explore a wide range of scenarios, complexities, and SQL techniques beyond this specific pattern.
